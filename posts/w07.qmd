## Tipping points {#sec-tipping-points}

![Height of the camel](images/mt_straw_camel.jpg){.column-margin}

-   **Tipping points are nonlinear models where a small change is
    leading to a big effect.**

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
### Critical Note

The straw that broke the Camel's back is utterly ridiculous example.
Here is perhaps a few better ones:
:::

1.  As the human body gains in muscle and loses fat it reaches a point
    where it can no longer float in water, at this point a swimmer must
    forever be treading water or swimming to keep afloat. The tipping
    point can also be viewed as drop survivability time for people in
    the sea.
2.  The volume of an explosive reaches a tipping point when it is
    detonated.
3.  Today most bridges can withstand cross winds. However in the past
    some bridge were not and cross wind during a storm could force a
    bridge to shake at its resonant frequency which caused it to break
    apart.

Also here are some worse examples of tipping point

1.  The drop in crime rate in New York is claimed by Malcom Gladwell to
    be an example of a tipping point. He suggested that "Broken Windows
    Theory" was what tipped crime rates in 1984 which was a policy of
    increasing the police force and getting them to crack down hard on
    misdemeanors like graffiti, jay-walking and free riding in the
    subway. Did this pretext of harassing minorities really motivated
    criminals to abandon crime, stop selling drugs, or emigrate to other
    cities with smaller police forces ?

In @donohue2001impact a more convicting hypothesis for the decline of
crime is presented. The economists also looked at other cities in the US
that experienced similar dramatic drops in crime. What they report is
that drops in crime rate took place in both rich cities that boosted
trier police force and in poor cities that could not afford to. The
point out that crimes follow a Pareto-distribution were 95% of all
violent crime in big cities is due to a very small population of career
criminals. They suggest that the drop was due to Roe Vs Wade passing
about 18 years with the outcome that teen-agers and single mothers were
able to avoid having children they could not support. The data required
lots of massaging (murders are solved long after they are reported,
there was a crack epidemic, some place had easier access to abortion
etc,) And while this effect seems to occur globally in different
localities after an 18 year lag this analysis has been challenged by
others researchers several times. See also [Legalized abortion and crime
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#cite_note-7)

A third hypothesis is that the crime levels are correlated with the use
of leaded gasoline. Lead is highly toxic to the human brain.

Often when people think about tipping points, they think of kinks in
curves. Sometimes a kink in a curve reflects a tipping point, but not
always. In many cases these kinks are just exponential growth, because
with exponential growth you have a curve that takes off at some point. A
book about tipping points [@gladwell2006tipping], written by [Malcolm
Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell).

It is important to see what is a tip and what is not, and also what kind
of models produce tips. Two famous models are the percolation model from
physics and SIS model from epidemiology. Percolation refers to the
question whether or not water can make its way through a certain layer,
e.g. the ground or a coffee filter. **SIS** stands for susceptible,
infected and susceptible again, which is a simple model for diseases.

There is a distinction between types of tips. There are direct tips and
contextual tips. With a direct tip or active tip, a variable itself
changes, which causes it to tip. e.g., a battle might tip a war. With a
contextual tip something changes in the environment that makes it
possible for the system to move from one state to another. e.g., the
density of the trees could tip the spread of a forest fire.

A system can be stable (in equilibrium), periodic, random or complex. A
system can tip from one state to another but there are also tips within
classes. e.g., a system might tip from one equilibrium to another
equilibrium.

![Percolation checker
board](images/mt_percolation_01.jpg){.column-margin}

## Percolation models {#sec-percolation-models}

[Percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation) models come
from physics. The idea is that water comes down in the form of rain and
the question is does the water percolate through the soil or not? To
make a model, you can simplify the situation by using a checkerboard.
The idea is that water can only percolate from one filled box to
another, including diagonal directions. In the example, the water can't
make it to the bottom.

![Percolation probability](images/mt_percolation_02.jpg){.column-margin}

The model is as follows. Assume that the graph is big. Let *p* be the
probability that a box gets filled. Then we ask the question: does it
percolate? As long as *p* is less than 59.2%, it doesn't percolate.
Above this value, the system tips, and then it suddenly becomes likely
that it does percolate.

What is causing the tip? For *p* less than 59.2%, there just aren't
enough boxes filled in. However, when the values passes 59.2%, it
suddenly becomes more likely that the water percolates to the bottom.

![Forest fire](images/mt_percolation_03.jpg){.column-margin}

This model can be applied to all kinds of things, for instance forest
fires. In this case, you can use the checkerboard to represent trees,
and the filled in boxes represent the density of the forest. e.g., you
set the forest density to 57% and set fire to all trees on the left side
in the model.

As you can see, the fire doesn't make it to the other side, even after
repeated attempts. If you push up forest density to 61%, nearly all
attempts will show that the forest fire makes it to the other side. This
is an example of the fertility of models. A model that was used to
explain percolation, can also be used for forest fires.

![Forest yield curve](images/mt_yield_curve.jpg){.column-margin}

Curiously, the 59.2% threshold is also a tipping point in the yield
curve of a forest. If you plant more trees, the yield of the forest in
terms of wood produced rises in a linear fashion, until the tipping
point, after which the yield will fall.

You can also apply this to banks. You can have a checkerboard of banks.
If one bank fails then all banks that have loaned a lot of money to this
bank may also fail. In this way bank failures can cascade.

![IMF bank model](images/mt_imf_bank_model.jpg){.column-margin}

The IMF has constructed models of banks that are more sophisticated.
This model uses sophisticated accounting equations where banks have
assets, capital, liabilities, and loans that are failing. You can then
stress the system by having banks fail and see how far the failures
spread.

This model is also based on the idea of percolation. In this model you
can also ask the question whether there is a tipping point, where
suddenly there are many bank failures? You could do the same with
country failures.

![People network](images/mt_people_network.jpg){.column-margin}

You can also apply this on information percolating. Information spreads
through networks of people. Assume that there is a probability that
people will tell a piece of information to their friends, then you could
ask what's the likelihood that the information percolates as a function
of this probability. The model would tell that if the piece of
information, e.g. a gossip, is juicy enough, then it's likely to spread.

Intuitively, you might think that there might be a linear relationship
between the value of information and the number of people hearing of it,
but if you use a network model with a probability of people telling the
information across links, then nothing happens if the information is not
very valuable, but once the value gets above some critical threshold,
you might see a tipping point, and almost everybody will hear about it.

![From A to B](images/mt_percolation_04.jpg){.column-margin}

This can also be applied to innovations. e.g., people may have been
working on some technology for years or decades, and then suddenly a lot
of people figure it out at approximately the same time. e.g., for a long
time nobody made a steam engine, and suddenly many people were building
steam engines. We see often bursts of scientific activity in a
particular area, e.g. biotechnology where many people work on the same
innovation at the same time.

Why does the percolation model apply here? Often finding a solution for
a particular type of problem, e.g. producing a car or getting a
mathematical proof, requires getting from A to B. There are many parts
that have to work together, and you need a significant number of partial
solutions to get through the whole problem. For instance, for a car you
need wheels, brakes, an engine and a steering wheel.

As information accumulates, we can fill in more squares, and eventually
someone can find a path from A to B. Suddenly there are multiple paths
so that others can find other paths from A to B. It is therefore
plausible that the percolation model explains those bursts in scientific
activity.

## Contagion models 1: Diffusion {#sec-contagion-models-1-diffusion}

![Diffusion graph](images/mt_diffusion.jpg){.column-margin}

In a diffusion model everybody receives something, which could be
information or a disease. The diffusion model works as follows:

-   Suppose that there is some new disease called Wobblies,
-   $W_t$ - is the number of people who got the Wobblies at time $t$.
-   $N$ is the total population.
-   $N - W_t$ is therfore the number of healthy.
-   $τ$ - is the transmission rate or the likelihood that someone sick
    infects someone healthy.

So, if two people meet, then what is the likelihood that one person
gives it to the other? $$
\tau \times \frac{W_t}{N} \times \frac{(N-W_t )}{N} \qquad
$$ {#eq-percolation-transmission-probability}

You need one person who has the Wobblies and one person that doesn't
have it. So the probability is

You can also apply this to a new technology being adopted or a piece of
information being spread, but in those cases people don't have to meet
physically.

The spreading also depends on the contact rate $c$, which is how often
people meet, then $cN$ is the number of meetings. Hence,

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t + c\times N \times τ \times \frac{W_t}{N}\frac{(N-W_t )}{N} \qquad
$$ {#eq-percolation-progression}

The formula says that the spread will start slow because only a few
people are affected, then speed up where more people are affected, and
then, when most people are affected, slows down again because there are
fewer people that can be affected. The model has no tipping point.

## Contagion models 2: SIS model {#sec-contagion-models-2-sis-model}

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\frac {dS}{dt}}&=-{\frac {\beta SI}{N}}+\gamma I\\[6pt]{\frac {dI}{dt}}&={\frac {\beta SI}{N}}-\gamma I
\end{aligned} \qquad
$$ {#eq-SIS-model}

The [SIS
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIS_model)
is much like the diffusion model but there is a difference. After people
have been infected, they can recover and move back to the susceptible
state. Hence,

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t + c\times N \times τ \times \frac{W_t}{N}\frac{(N-W_t )}{N} - a \times W_t \qquad
$$ {#eq-sis-progression}

where:

-   *a* is the recovery rate.

This can be simplified to $$
W_{t+1} = W_t (1 +(cτ\frac{(N - W_t)}{N} - a) )\qquad 
$$

This model is interesting, because if the recovery rate is higher than
the transmission rate, then the disease is not going to spread. This
model has a tipping point.

If $W_t$ is very small, then $\frac{N - W_t}{N} \approx 1$ so
$W_t+1 = W_t(1 + cτ - a)$.

The disease is going to spread if $cτ - a > 0$ or $cτ > a$ or
$\frac{cτ}{a} > 1$.

$$
R_0 \def \frac {cτ}{a}
$$

is the basic reproduction number $R_0$.

-   if $R_0 > 1$ then the disease will spread.
-   If $R_0 < 1$ the disease dies off.
-   The tipping point is 0.

Diseases like measles (15), mumps (5) and flu (3) have $R_0 > 0$.

If you have had the measles or the mumps, you don't become susceptible
again, so here the SIR model applies.

![Stable dynamic model](images/mt_dynamic_model_01.jpg){.column-margin}

This model is interesting for policy decisions on how many people need
to be vaccinated. Assume *V* to be the proportion of people vaccinated,
then the altered basic reproduction number will be $r0 = R0(1 - V)$. So,
to keep the disease from spreading, we need $r_0 < 1$ or
$R_0(1 - V) < 1$ or $1 - \frac{1}{R_0} < V$.

e.g., if we want to keep the measles from spreading, and measles has a
$R_0 = 15$, then we need $1 - 1/15 = 14/15$ of the people to be
vaccinated.

There is also a tipping point with regard to vaccines. Below the tipping
point only the people that are vaccinated are protected. Above the
tipping point everyone is protected.

    $1 - \frac{1}{R_0} < V$

## Classifying tipping points {#sec-classifying-tipping-points}

The basic idea of a dynamical system is in the graph to the left. What
does the graph say? If says that *x* is going to change over time. If
*y* is positive, then *x* is going to change in the direction of the
arrows on the left. However, if *y* is negative, then *x* is going to
change in the direction of the arrows on the right. This system moves to
a stable equilibrium where *x = y/2*.

![Dynamic model with tipping
point](images/mt_dynamic_model_02.jpg){.column-margin}

More complicated graphs are possible. In the next graph, if *x \< 0.2*
then it will move to 0, and if *x \> 0.2* then it will move to 0.5. In
this case there are two stable equilibria, while and 0.2 is an unstable
equilibrium or a tipping point. This is called a direct tip, where a
slight change in a variable will cause the variable to move into another
direction.

![Contextual change](images/mt_dynamic_model_03.jpg){.column-margin}

With a direct tip, a small change in the variable itself, can have a
large effect on its end state. e.g., the assassination of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand tipped the whole system so that Europe went to war. Often
directs tips were destined to happen, because the environment has become
supportive of such an event.

If more and more preconditions are met, then the percolation model
suggests that it is going to happen anyway. e.g., in the eve of World
War I, the European powers were already forming alliances and preparing
for war. So, often what causes a direct tip, is a change in the context.
This is a contextual tip.

![Types of systems](images/mt_system_types.jpg){.column-margin}

You can also apply this to the second graph. If you move down the line a
little bit, then the system tips, and *x* will always move to 0. A
contextual tip means that a small change in the environment has a large
effect on the end state, often because of the number of squares filled
in in the percolation model has reached the tipping point.

![State switches](images/mt_state_switches.jpg){.column-margin}

This also applies to the SIS model where *R0 = cτ - a* and if *R0 \> 1*
then the disease spreads. If we change the virulence of the disease, or
the rate at which people make contact, or the rate at which people
recover, then the context changes.

A system can be stable (in equilibrium), periodic, random or complex. A
system can tip from one class to another but there are also tips within
classes. e.g., a system might tip from one equilibrium to another
equilibrium. This can be represented in a graph that depicts the
movement of a variable *x* depending on some other variable *r*.

![Active tip](images/mt_active_tip.jpg){.column-margin}

## Measuring tips {#sec-measuring-tips}

When measuring tips, we try to find out whether how likely the tip was
going to happen. With an active or direct tip, the variable itself can
cause the system to tip. If the system is at a tipping point, it is
uncertain how it will behave. Once a tip has occurred, we know for
certain how the system is going to behave. One way of measuring
tippiness is by *reductions in uncertainty*.

A measure of uncertainty can be changes in the likelihood of different
outcomes that could occur. Initially, there may be a large number of
possible outcomes. After the system tips, there might be an equilibrium
or one possible outcome, or a number of other things could occur. We
measure changes in the likelihood of different outcomes using the
diversity index, which is used in social sciences, and entropy, which
comes from physics and information theory.

The **diversity index** for *i* possible outcomes is

$$
\frac{1}{\sum P_i^²}
$$

e.g., if we have three possible outcomes A, B and C, with probabilities

*P(A) = 1/2*, *P(B) = 1/3* and *P(C) = 1/6*,

then the diversity index is

$1 / (1/4 + 1/9 + 1/36) = 36/14 ≈ 2.57$.

For *i* possible outcomes, the maximum diversity is *i*.

e.g., if we have four possible outcomes A, B, C and D, which all have a
probability of 1/4, so

$P(A) = 1/4, P(B) = 1/4, P(C) = 1/4 and P(D) = 1/4$, then the diversity
index is

$1 / ((1/4)² + (1/4)² + (1/4)² + (1/4)²) = 4.$

**How can we use the diversity index to measure tips?**

If changes in a variable cause changes in the diversity index, this is
indicative of a tip.

e.g., if initially there were three possible values, and the diversity
index was 2.57, and then it flips to 1, the change in value of the
diversity index is the measure of the tip.

**Entropy** also measures the degree of uncertainty.

The formula for entropy is:

$$
-\sum_i P(X_i) log_2(P(X_i))
$$

*log2* is the inverse of the power of 2, so *log2(2x) = x*. e.g.,
log2(1/4) = log2(2-2) = -2. e.g., if we have four possible outcomes A,
B, C and D, which all have a probability of 1/4, then the entropy is -
((1/4)*log2(1/4) + (1/4)*log2(1/4) + (1/4)*log2(1/4) + (1/4)*log2(1/4))
= 2.

Entropy tells us the number of bits of information we need to know to
identify the outcome. If we have four possible outcomes A, B, C and D,
which all have a probability of 1/4, you can split up the possiblities
in half. It is either in A, B or in C, D. This is one bit of
information. If it is in C, D then you need to know whether it is C or
D. This is the second bit of information. You can always find the answer
by asking two questions. Hence, the entropy is 2.

The diversity index shows the number of types. The entropy is the amount
of information you need to identify the type. e.g., if you have options
A and B that each have a probability of 1/2, then the diversity index is
2 and the entropy is 1. After the system tips, the diversity index goes
to 1 and the entropy becomes 0, and you don't need to ask any question
to know what the state of the system is. Tips are changes in the
likelihood of outcomes.
