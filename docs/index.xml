  <title>Lesson 13 - Path dependence</title>

<section id="sec-path-dependence" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-path-dependence">Path dependence</h3>
<p><strong>Path dependence</strong> means that what happens at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> depends on all time steps <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%3CT">. Or put plainly that history matters.</p>
<p>This is clearly quite different from Markov process models where only the current state matters and history does not.</p>
<p>Urn models can help to understand path dependence, and to distinguish between different types of path dependence. 1. deterministic outcome such as what happens today could be path dependent, 2. stochastic path dependence which is an equilibrium distribution over all possible outcomes of what happens in the long run could also be path dependent.</p>
<div id="exm-path-QWERTY" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 1</strong></span> One of the most famous examples of path dependence involves the standard typewriter keyboard configuration called QWERTY. Initially, there were lots of different keyboard configurations, but it turned out that in the path through which history played out, QWERTY ended up getting locked in due to a process of increasing returns. The more people had QWERTY, the more people wanted it, and the more typewriters that were built with it, and so it became locked in.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Path dependence</strong> means that outcome probabilities depend on the sequence of previous outcomes, which is called the path.</p>
<p><strong>Phat dependence</strong> means that outcome probabilities depend on past outcomes but not on their order. The past impacts the outcome but it doesn’t necessarily determine it.</p>
<div id="exm-path-technology" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 2</strong></span> With choices over technology such as keyboards, alternating current or direct current, or gasoline cars versus electric cars.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-path-law" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 3</strong></span> The law which evolves through precedent depends on earlier laws and their interpretation made by judges in the past.</p>
</div>
<p>It also the case with institutional choices like having a single payer healthcare system or defined benefits pensions versus defined contributions. These choices can depend on previous institutional choices. Economic success can also depend on sequences of past outcomes. e.g., Ann Arbor had the largest public university while Jackson had the largest prison. Population in Ann Arbor increased from 10,000 in 1910 to 110,000 in 2000 while in Jackson it first increased and then declined and grew only from 31,000 in 1910 to 36,000 in 2000. The public university greatly helped Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Path dependence often coincide with increasing returns. If you build a university then other educational institutions like hospitals, and law schools that weren’t originally part of the university, could join in. Eventually, you grow through a virtuous cycle. Increasing returns means building success on top of success. Path dependence isn’t the same as increasing returns.</p>
<p>Chaos is often referred to as ESTIC, or <strong>E</strong>xtreme <strong>S</strong>ensitivity <strong>T</strong>o <strong>I</strong>nitial <strong>C</strong>onditions. Chaos means that, even when the starting points A and B are very close to each other, subsequent paths can diverge tremendously. Chaos deals with initial points while path dependence deals with the path. Path dependence in a <em>dynamic process</em> that has a state in each period differs from a Markov process. These path dependent processes violate the <em>fixed transition probabilities</em> assumption of the Markov Process. In Urn models transition probabilities change, and that is how history can matter.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-urn-models">Urn models</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urn_problem">Urn models</a> can be used to distinguish between processes that are path-dependent and processes where the order doesn’t matter. They can also be used to distinguish between processes that have outcomes in a given period that are path-dependent, and processes that have long-run equilibria of distributions over the set of outcomes that are path-dependent.</p>
<p>An urn model is a container with blue and red balls. You pick balls out of the urn. The ball you pick is the outcome. There is a probability of picking out balls of different colors. The simplest urn model is the Bernoulli model where Outcomes are independent of previous outcomes. The number of balls in the urn is fixed,</p>
<p>:::{#exm-path-Pólya-urn}{.column-margin}</p>
<p>Three red balls and one blue ball. After picking a ball, you return it into the urn. The probability of picking up a red ball is constant and always 3/4.<br>
:::</p>
<p>The most famous path-dependent process is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_urn_model">Pólya process</a>. It works starts with an urn with two balls, one of them red and one of them blue. You pick a ball, and after you pick that ball, you put back the ball and add another ball of the same color you just picked. This can be repeated over and over again. Over time, probabilities change as more and more balls are added. This process is path-dependent as the probabilities depend on the path of previous choices.</p>
<p>The Pólya process might apply to fashion. If more people are wearing a red shirt, this increases the probability that more people will be wearing red shirts. The interesting properties of the Pólya process are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Any probability of red balls is an equilibrium and equally likely, i.e.&nbsp;3% is as likely as 88%;</li>
<li>Any sequence of <em>R</em> red balls and <em>B</em> blue balls is equally likely, e.g.&nbsp;RBBRB is as likely as RRBBB.</li>
</ol>
<p>The opposite of the Pólya process is the <strong>Balancing Process</strong> where you return the ball but also add a new ball of the opposite color as the ball you just picked. The balancing process converges to equal percentages of the two colors of balls. This might apply to situations where you want to keep different constituencies happy,</p>
<div id="exm-path-party-convention" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 4</strong></span> e.g.&nbsp;a party convention in the United States might be put it in a northern state or a southern state. If it is put a northern state, this increases the probability that it is going to be put it in a southern state four years later.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Pólya Process, the equilibrium is incredibly path-dependent, but in the balancing process it is not. There is also a distinction between the period outcomes, which is what happens in a particular period, e.g.&nbsp;red or blue, versus what the distribution of balls in the urn looks like in the long run. Path-dependent outcomes means that what happens in a period depends on what happened in the past. That is true for both the Pólya process and the balancing process.</p>
<p>Path-dependent equilibrium means that what happens in the long run depends on the process along the way. The Pólya process has both path-dependent equilibria and path-dependent outcomes. The balancing process only has path-dependent outcomes. The equilibrium is always 1/2 and it doesn’t depend on what happened along the way. In the balancing process, history matters at each step in time. However, that doesn’t mean that what happens in the long run depends on the path.</p>
<p>Two examples from history can illustrate this.</p>
<div id="exm-path-manifest-destiny" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 5</strong></span> The United States had the idea of manifest destiny, meaning that the United States was likely to be a country that stretched from sea to sea. History played out in particular ways, but some people argue that it didn’t matter as the United States was destined to be a country that stretched from sea to sea.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-path-railroads" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 6</strong></span> Another example is the railroads. Some people argue that once the railroads were invented, building them became inevitable. The lay of each track was path-dependent, but the long-run outcome may not have been as the tracks were laid where it was economically efficient.</p>
</div>
<p>Path-dependence means that the outcome probabilities depend on the sequence of past outcomes. Phat-dependence means that outcome probabilities depend on past outcomes but not their order. The Pólya process is phat-dependent. All that matters is the set of outcomes, not the order in which they appeared.</p>

<figcaption>The sway process</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Why is the difference between path-dependent versus phat-dependent so important? If there are 30 picks then there are 230 or over a billion different paths. The number of possible sets is only 31. The number of blue balls could have been 0, 1, …, 30. If it is set dependent, there are only 31 different possibilities. If it is path dependent, that means there are more than a billion possibilities.</p>
<p>The sway process is path-dependent. It starts with one blue and one red ball. When a ball is picked, a ball of that same color is added, just like the Pólya process, also <em>2t-s - 2t-s-1</em> balls of the color of the ball chosen in each period <em>s</em> less than <em>t</em>.</p>
<p>e.g., in period one, you pick a blue ball and you add a blue ball. In period two, you pick a red ball, so you add a red ball, and also add a blue ball for the blue ball you picked in period one. In period three, you pick a blue ball and add a blue ball, but also a red ball for the red ball you picked in period two. And now you add two blue balls, so you multiply times two the blue ball that you picked in period one. In period four, you get a red ball, so now you add a red ball, and a blue ball for period three, and two red balls for period two, a four, or two times two, blue balls for period one.</p>
<p>This process is called the sway because, as you go back in time, decisions take on more and more weight. In this way the path is taking on more and more influence. So, when people talk about path dependence, e.g.&nbsp;in law, institutional choices, or technological adoptions, they think about early movers having a bigger effect and the past having an increasing weight. One way you can get full path dependence, is by having that sort of process.</p>

<section id="sec-mathematics-on-urn-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-mathematics-on-urn-models">Mathematics on urn models</h3>
<p>For the Pólya process, each equilibrium is equally likely, and any history of <em>R</em> red balls and <em>B</em> blue balls is equally likely. This can be proven. The Pólya process starts with one red ball and one blue ball. Then a ball is picked. Then the ball is returned an another ball of the same color is added. This process is repeated. Let’s first prove that any history of <em>B</em> blue balls and <em>R</em> red balls is equally likely because this proof can be used to prove that each equilibrium is equally likely.</p>
<p>Proving that any history of <em>R</em> red balls and <em>B</em> blue balls is equally likely, is easy. e.g., <em>P(RBBB) = (1/2)(1/3)(2/4)(3/5) = (11</em>2<em>3)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/20 and <em>P(BBBR) = (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(1/5) = (12</em>3<em>1)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/20. Also <em>P(RBRB) = (1/2)(1/3)(2/4)(2/5) = (11</em>2<em>2)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/30 and <em>P(BBRR) = (1/2)(2/3)(1/4)(2/5) = (12</em>1<em>2)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/30.</p>
<p>You first make a pick out of 2 balls. Then you make a pick out of 3 balls. If you make <em>N</em> picks, the denominator will be <em>N!</em>. If you make <em>N</em> picks and end up with <em>B</em> blue balls, you have to pick <em>N-B</em> red balls. For blue balls, you pick first out of 1, then out of 2. This continues until you pick out of <em>B</em>. For red balls, you pick first out of 1, then out of 2. This continues until you pick out of <em>N-B</em>. The numerator will then be <em>B!(N-B)!. So, for any N</em> picks with <em>B</em> blue balls, the probability is (B!(N-B)!)/N!.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to prove that any probability of red balls is an equilibrium that is equally likely to happen. e.g., <em>P(BBBB) = (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5) = (12</em>3<em>4)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/5 and <em>P(BBBR) = (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(1/5) = (12</em>3<em>1)/(2</em>3<em>4</em>5) = 1/20. Now, there are four ways in which one red ball could emerge, which are RBBB, BRBB, BBRB and BBBR. They are equally likely to happen, so <em>P(RBBB) + P(BRBB) + P(BBRB) + P(BBBR) = 1/20 + 1/20 + 1/20 + 1/20 = 1/5</em>.</p>
<p>Now <em>P(50B) = P(50R) = (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)…(49/50)(50/51) = 1/51</em>. Now <em>P(49B 1R)</em> is a bit more complicated. The probability of picking 49 blue balls first and 1 red ball last is (1/50)*(1/51). There are 50 ways in which that one red ball could emerge, so <em>P(49B 1R) = P(1B 49R) = 50(1/50</em>51) = 1/51.</p>
<p><em>P(47B 3R)</em> is even more complicated. Assume first that the three red balls are last. You first pick a blue ball with probability 1/2. Then a blue ball with probability 1/2. This goes on until you pick a blue ball with probability 47/48. Then you pick a red ball with probability 1/49, then another red ball with probability 1/50, and another red ball with probability 1/51. So you get a probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D)(%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D)%5Cldots(%5Cfrac%7B47%7D%7B48%7D)(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B49%7D)(%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B50%7D)(%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B51%7D)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B(47!)(3!)%7D%7B(51!)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B(1%20%5Ctimes%202%20%5Ctimes%203)%7D%7B(48%20%5Ctimes%2049%20%5Ctimes%2050%20%5Ctimes%2051)%7D">.</p>
<p>There are 3 red balls, so there are 50 places where the first one could have been, then 49 places for the second one, and 48 places for the third one. But picking red balls on places 12, 29, and 38 is the same as 29, 12 and 38 or 38, 12 and 29, so we have to take into account the different orders. Three balls can be in 3<em>2</em>1 = 3! = 6 different orders. Now the probability is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B(1%20%5Ctimes%202%20%5Ctimes%203)%7D%7B(48%20%5Ctimes%2049%20%5Ctimes%2050%20%5Ctimes%2051)%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B(50%20%5Ctimes%2049%20%5Ctimes%2048)%7D%7B(3%20%5Ctimes%202%20%5Ctimes%201)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B51%7D">. In this way it is possible to arrive at the conclusion that any probability of red balls is an equilibrium that is equally likely.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-path-dependence-and-chaos">Path dependence and Chaos</h3>
<p>Path dependence means that the outcome probabilities depend on the sequences of past outcomes. There are path dependent outcomes and path dependent long run equilibria. Markov processes have a unique stochastic equilibrium that is not path-dependent. Markov processes are not path dependent because of the fixed transition probabilities. In the urn model where balls are added based on the color of the ball picked, the transition probabilities change.</p>

Chaos is often referred to as <strong>ESTIC</strong>, or <strong>e</strong>xtreme <strong>s</strong>ensitivity <strong>t</strong>o <strong>i</strong>nitial <strong>c</strong>onditions. Chaos means that, even when the starting points A and B are very close to each other, then after many iterations of the outcome function they differ by arbitrary amounts.</p>

<figcaption>Tent map example</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Recursive functions can be used to describe processes that are chaotic. In a recursive function, the outcome at time <em>t</em> depends on the outcomes of previous periods, so <em>xt = f(x1, x2, …, xt-2, xt-1)</em>, e.g.&nbsp;f(xt) = xt-1 + 2, which would give 1, 3, 5, 9, 11.</p>
<p>An example is the tent map. For <em>x</em> in <em>(0,1)</em> meaning that <em>0 &lt; x &lt; 1</em>, if <em>x &lt; 1/2</em> then <em>f(x) = 2x</em> and if <em>x ≥ 1/2</em> then <em>f(x) = 2 - 2x</em>. Starting with 0.21 it would give 0.42, 0.84, 0.32, 0.64. An example of the tent map, which starts with two points that are very similar, one being 0.4321, and the other being 0.4322, shows that after a few periods, the two points are a long way away from each other.</p>
<p>The tent map ends up being chaotic because there is extreme sensitivity to the initial condition. This is not path dependence. Once the initial point is chosen, then it is possible to calculate exactly what’s going to happen. So chaos, in its standard form means extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.</p>
<p>A process is independent if outcomes don’t depend on the past history of outcomes. This independence is a probabilistic concept, e.g.&nbsp;a 50% chance of getting a red or blue ball each period. A process depends on the initial conditions if the outcomes depend only on the initial state so that it is completely deterministic. Path dependence means that the outcome probabilities of what happens in the long run, depends on what happens along the way. Phat dependence means that outcome probabilities don’t depend on the order in which things happen but only depend on the set of things.</p>
<p>When historians or institutional scholars think about path dependence, they often think in terms of the sequence of events mattering, not just the set of things mattering. They also think that events aren’t independent, and they think that although initial conditions matter, other things matter too.</p>
<p>If things happened independently then there is no structure in history and that doesn’t make any sense. Extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in a deterministic process doesn’t make sense either. That means that fate is completely predetermined by initial choices. It is also not phat, because then only the set of previous events matters, and not the order. Imagine America buying Louisiana from France before becoming independent. That doesn’t make sense.</p>

<section id="sec-path-dependence-and-increasing-returns" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-path-dependence-and-increasing-returns">Path Dependence and Increasing Returns</h3>
<p>Increasing returns means that, the more there is of something, or the more people that do something, the more people want of it, or the more other people are going to do it. e.g., the more people to get QWERTY typewriters, and the more other people want these typewriters. There are two reasons for this. First, people can then use somebody else’s machine more easily. Second, from a production standpoint, it makes more sense to standardize. So there are positive feedbacks. More produces more.</p>
<p>This is like the Pólya process. The more blue balls are picked, the more likely blue balls are picked in the future. So, many people think that increasing returns cause path dependence. Both the sway and the Pólya process have increasing returns. The balancing process, which doesn’t produce path dependence, didn’t have increasing returns. In fact, it had decreasing returns. The more red balls were picked, the more blue balls were picked in the urn.</p>
<p>Is increasing returns the same thing as path dependence? You can get increasing returns without path dependence. The gas/electric model represents the choice between gas cars and electric cars. Both had a positive feedback, e.g.&nbsp;more cars of a specific type meant more production and more filling stations of a specific type. However, when automobiles were first developed, gas cars had much larger increasing returns than electric cars because of the storage problems for electricity. Furthermore, you can add a gas engine to an electric car, so adding an electric engine also makes another gas engine more likely.</p>
<p>This can be represented by the following model. Assume that you start with five blue balls and one red ball. If you pick a red ball, you add one red ball and one blue ball. If you pick a blue ball, you add ten blue balls. The chance of picking a blue ball first is 1/5. If that happens, the chance of picking another blue ball is 2/7. These are increasing returns. Increasing returns to blue balls are much larger. If you run this process, the blue balls win out every single time. This process isn’t path dependent, but it has increasing returns, hence increasing returns are not the same as path-dependence.</p>
<p>You can also get path dependence without increasing returns, e.g.&nbsp;with symbiotes. You start with one red ball, one blue ball, one green ball, and one yellow ball in the urn. If a red ball is picked, you add a green one. If a green ball is picked, you add a red one. If a blue ball is picked, you add a yellow one. If a yellow ball is picked, you add a blue one. There are no increasing returns, because if a red ball is added, this increases the odds of green. If you order the balls into two sets, which are <em>{red, green}</em> and <em>{blue, yellow}</em> then the process is path-dependent but doesn’t have increasing returns.</p>
<p>Increasing returns is logically distinct from path dependence but often in history path-dependence was caused by increasing returns. The urn models can be used to clarify that. Increasing returns is not the only way you get path dependence. To understand that, you have to move beyond urn models and look at externalities or the interdependencies between decisions.</p>
<div id="exm-path-public-projects" class="theorem example page-columns page-full">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 7</strong></span> <strong>Public projects</strong> like building a nuclear power plant, or creating a national park, are huge economic decisions that affect a lot of other things, so they create externalities.</p>

<figcaption>Projects and externalities</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This can be illustrated using model. Assume there are five projects A, B, C, D, and E. Each one has a value of 10 of its own but they also create some externalities. The matrix represents the size of the externalities between projects, e.g.&nbsp;the externalities between project A and project B are -10. If you start with A, the returns are 10. If you then plan to to B, then AB returns 10 + 10 + 20 = 0, so it doesn’t make sense to to B after A.</p>
<p>Now AC returns 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 so it makes sense to do C after A. Now doing ACD returns 10 + 10 + 5 + 10 - 10 + 0 = 25, so doing D after AC makes no difference. If you start with B first, then it makes no sense to to A. After doing B, there is no benefit from doing C so C might not happen. D will be done because of the externality of 30 with B.</p>
</div>
<p>The projects that get done don’t only depend on the initial conditions, in this case the project picked first, but also on the externalities of the projects that have been done in the past. If most of the externalities are positive, there is less path-dependence than when the externalities are negative, because positive externalities create increasing returns and make other projects more likely. A big cause of path-dependence is externalities.</p>

<section id="sec-path-dependent-or-tipping-point" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-path-dependent-or-tipping-point">Path dependent or tipping point</h2>
<p>Path dependence and tipping points seem closely related concepts. Path dependence means that outcome probabilities depend on the sequence of past outcomes. There are path dependent outcomes, meaning that what happens in a given period depends on the path, and path dependent equilibria, meaning that what happens in the long run depends on what happens along the way. Tipping points are related to path-dependent equilibria.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/notes-model-thinking/posts/images/mt_active_tip.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Active tip</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Recall that there are two types of tipping points:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Direct/Active tip</dt>
<dd>
<p>a variable itself changes, which causes it to tip. In Schelling’s model this is the agent moving house.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Contextual tip</dt>
<dd>
<p>a change in the environment triggers one or more transitions in the system. In Schelling’s model this is a preferred neighbor moving out or a unwanted neighbor moving in.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Path dependence can be related to direct tips.</p>
<p>The difference between path-dependence and tipping points is that path-dependence means that what happened along the way has an effect. Each step may have a small effect. A tipping point is a single instance in time where, where the equilibrium suddenly changes drastically. A singular event suddenly tips the system abruptly.</p>
<p>To measure tips, you can use measures of uncertainty like the diversity index, which shows the probability of different equilibria, and entropy, which measures how much information there is in the system. For the Pólya process any probability distribution of red balls is an equilibrium and equally likely. When drawing four balls, five things could happen, which are drawing zero, one, two, three or four red balls. Each is equally likely, so the probability of each option is 1/5 so the diversity index is 5.</p>
<p>Suppose that the first ball is red. Then the following could happen. The probability of having four red balls is <em>(2/3)(3/4)(4/5) = 2/5</em>. The probability of having three red balls and one blue ball is <em>(2/3)(3/4)(1/5)3 = (1/10)</em>3 = 3/10 as the blue ball could be in three locations. The probability of having two red balls and two blue balls is <em>(2/3)(1/4)(2/5)3 = (1/15)</em>3 = 1/5 as the additional red ball could be in three locations. The probability of having four blue balls is <em>(1/3)(2/4)(3/5) = 1/10</em>. Now, <em>P(4R) = 4/10</em>, <em>P(4R) = 4/10</em>, <em>P(3R) = 3/10</em>, and <em>P(1R) = 1/10</em>, so the diversity index is <em>1/((4/10)² + (3/10)² + (2/10)² + (1/10)²) = 30/100 ≈ 3.33</em>.</p>
<p>This movement of the diversity index suggests that something happened along the path affecting the outcome probabilities. There is path dependence, but it is not abruptly tipped. Abruptly tipped would be moving from 5 to 1 or 1.2 so that one single event would get rid of a lot of uncertainty. The difference between path dependence and tipping points is one of degree. Path dependence is more gradual. Tipping points are more abrupt.</p>

  <title>Lesson 12 - Coordination and Culture</title>

<section id="sec-coordination-and-culture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-coordination-and-culture">Coordination and culture</h2>
<p>Coordination is doing the same somebody else is doing. Culture refers to differences between groups of interacting people. In order to have these differences between groups of people, there have to be similarities within those groups. That is where coordination matters. Cultural behavior can be suboptimal in the sense of efficiency. Often it doesn’t make sense from the outsider’s perspective, but viewed from within that culture, it makes sense.</p>
<p>The pure coordination game that enables us to understand why people do the same thing, and why sometimes they do the same thing that is not optimal. In the context of this game, an important question is does the whole system coordinate if people are trying to coordinate? To understand that, the Lyapunov function can be used on a single coordination game on one behavior.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have a many-action coordination game on multiple behaviors. This can be used to explain cultural differences. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod">Robert Axelrod</a> made a model that looks at how culture emerges, and why you might get thick boundaries between different cultures. There is also inconsistency within cultures. The coordination consistency model deals with both coordination between people and consistency within a person with the use of Markov processes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-what-is-culture-and-why-do-we-care">What is culture and why do we care?</h2>
<p>There are many definitions of culture. Culture is such a complex thing that no simple definition can capture it. Still, culture mattes a lot for the success of countries. Tylor, who is the father of modern cultural anthropology, said in 1871 that culture is the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals and customs. Boas extended this in 1911 by calling culture the totality of mental and physical reactions and activities that characterize behavioral responses to environment, others and to the self.</p>
<p>Boas was the first to get the idea that there should be some consistency across these mental and physical reactions to the world. This consistency could be partly brought on with the environment or it could be socially constructed. These dry academic definitions don’t show exactly what culture is. Writers have also written definitions of culture, e.g.&nbsp;Calvin Trilling wrote in 1955:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When we look at people in the degree of abstraction which the idea of culture implies, we cannot but be touched and impressed by what we see, we cannot help but be awed by something mysterious at work, some creative power that seems to transcend any particular act or habit or quality that may be observed. To make a coherent life, to confront the terrors of the outer and the inner world, to establish the ritual and art, the pieties and duties which make possible the life of the group and the individual - these are culture, and to contemplate these various enterprises which constitute a culture is inevitably moving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make a coherent life refers to the idea of consistency. An essential reason for the existence of culture is to made possible the life of the group and the individual. In order for groups and individuals to function, they have to have some similarities within. They have to agree or coordinate on certain sets of behaviors, morals, laws, customs, and understandings, in order to confront the inner and outer world. The interesting thing about cultures is that people do this in different ways.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>What could these differences be? And how extreme can these differences be? One way of figuring this out is doing experiments. The ultimatum game is an experiment that was done in different societies. Player 1 is given $10. Then player 1 is told to offer a split to player 2. The split might vary, e.g.&nbsp;$5 apiece, $2 for player 2 or even $0.01 for player 2. Player 2 can either accept or reject. If player 2 accepts the money, then they split it. If he rejects, they both get nothing.</p>
<p>Player 1 has to figure out what’s the minimum amount he can offer player 2 to get it accepted. People from different cultures didn’t play the game in the same way. One group were the Lamalera, who are Indonesian whale hunters that hunt collectively. Another group, the Machigenga, who are an Amazonian group that hunted individually and didn’t even use names, was much more selfish. On average the Lamalera offered $5.70, while the Machigenga offered $2.60.</p>

</div></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Inglehart">Ron Inglehart</a>, who spent decades surveying people all over the world doing something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey">World Value Survey</a>, constructed a graph by ranking different cultures on two dimensions, which are survival versus self-expression and traditional versus secular-rational. If you divide countries in these two ways, then the whole world makes sense by geography. e.g., protestant Europe is in the self-expressive secular realm while Islamic and African countries are more in the religious and survival-based area.</p>
<p>This map might suggest that all people from Sweden or Zimbabwe score the same. That is not true. Each country has a population and within this population there are differences. The point on the graph is just an average. The individual data points are clouds. But there is very little overlap between the scores of individuals in Sweden and Zimbabwe, so there is a difference between people from Sweden and Zimbabwe, but also differences within the Swedish people and within the people from Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Hofstede">Geert Hofstede</a>, who focused on the business world, uses five dimensions to make sense of cultures, which are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Power distance or how much inequality is tolerated,</li>
<li>Uncertainty avoidance versus risk taking,</li>
<li>Individualism versus collectivism,</li>
<li>Masculinity versus femininity, and</li>
<li>Confucianism versus dynamism or how forward looking are you?</li>
</ol>
<p>The US scores are: power distance 32 (a low value signaling a lot of inequality tolerance), uncertainty avoidance 40 (low), individualism 90 (very high), and masculinity 60 (high). The scores of France are: power distance 61 (a high value signaling little inequality tolerance), uncertainty avoidance 80 (very high), individualism 63 (high), and masculinity 32 (low). Those dimensions are useful because they capture differences. But those dimensions don’t capture everything. e.g., South Korea and El Salvador score practically the same on Hofstede’s dimension, but they are completely different countries.</p>
<p>Why should we care about culture? This is because the economy, political systems and society work through social exchanges. According to Kenneth Arrow:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust, certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time. It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption>Wealth versus trust</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>In cultures there are different levels of trust, and these different levels of trust have huge implications for how well political, economic, social, and religious institutions perform in terms of meeting the needs of the citizens. Bob Solow, who invented the growth model, wanted these notions of trust and social capital to be measurable in some way. That is one of the reasons why we have models like those of Inglehart and Hofstede.</p>
<p>How do you measure something like trust? This can be done using questions like do you claim government benefits you are not entitled to? Do you avoid paying a fare on public transport? Do you cheat on your taxes? Do you keep money if you found it? Do you fail to report damage you’ve done accidentally to a parked vehicle? These sort of questions indicate how trusting are people within a society.</p>
<p>You can also ask the question, do you think people in general can be trusted? There are massive differences across countries. In Sweden 70% of people answer this question positively. In Italy, it is 33%, and in Turkey it is only 10%. That is going to affect how well the economy is going to work.</p>
<p>It does matter a lot, because in general, rich countries have a higher level of trust. There is a correlation between trust and wealth, but that doesn’t imply that trust causes higher levels of wealth even though that seems plausible. It might also be that higher levels of wealth make people more trustworthy.</p>

<section id="sec-pure-coordination-game" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pure-coordination-game">Pure coordination game</h2>
<p>To make sense of cultural differences, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game">pure coordination game</a> can be used. Some examples help to understand the pure coordination game. The ketchup question is do you store your ketchup in the fridge or the cupboard? Most Americans store their ketchup in the fridge, but people from England tend to store it in the cupboard. Where you store your ketchup is a cultural decision. You store it in the same place other people store their ketchup. This is an example of a coordination game. It is a situation where you do the same thing other people do, otherwise they can’t find the ketchup.</p>

<figcaption>Dagen H logo</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Other examples are electrical outlet plugs. Different countries have different plug configurations. Everybody in the country wants to coordinate on the same plug type, but different countries may coordinate on different types of plugs. The ramifications of failure to coordinate can be rather severe.</p>
<p>On the third of September in 1967 (Dagen H) at 4:00 AM, Sweden switched the side of the road they drove on from left to right. People from Sweden drove to other countries and caused accidents. It is also easier to make cars with steering wheels on the same side. England and some former British colonies still drive on the left. Those countries are mostly islands. On an island, you don’t have to worry about crossing a border and causing an accident. That is a coordination game.</p>

<figcaption>Pure coordination game</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This can be turned into a formal game. A game is a set of players with actions and payoffs. In the pure coordination game there are two players, and each player has one action. e.g., they can put the ketchup in the fridge or they can put it in the cupboard. If they both put their ketchup in the fridge, both get a payoff of one. If they both put their ketchup in the cupboard, both also get a payoff of one. But if one of them one puts it in the cupboard, and the other one puts it in the fridge, then each player gets zero because neither one can find the ketchup.</p>

<figcaption>N-person coordination game</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>The game can be expanded to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> persons that have to decide about something like driving left or right or whether the ketchup should be stored in the fridge or in the cupboard. Assume that they play this game against their two neighbors and switch their behavior if both neighbors behave differently. Because people want to coordinate their behavior to match other people they change their behavior to create the similarities within. After three steps you also see differences between groups emerging.</p>
<p>Does this game actually lead to similarities? Does this process stop or does it keep on churning? The answer can be found using the Lyapunov functions. If the process can be represented by a function that has a maximum, and it goes up by at least some fixed amount each time if it moves, then the process is going to stop at some point.</p>
<p>If this pure coordination game is played asymmetrically, that means having only one person moving at a time, which is unlike the example in the graph, then you can show that it satisfies the Lyapunov function of the number of coordinations. e.g., if someone switches to blue, the number of coordination goes up by two. There is also a maximum to the number of coordinations, meaning that everyone has the same color, so the process has to stop. The process doesn’t have to stop with everybody being the same as you can get a boundary between the colors.</p>

<figcaption>Inefficient coordination</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>There is a difference between coordination and the standing ovation problem. In the coordination model, e.g.&nbsp;choosing the side of the road to drive on, there is a measurable difference in payoffs so no-one would choose not to coordinate. In the standing ovation model it is more a psychological effect. It is no problem to differ from other people.</p>
<p>Inefficient coordination refers to behavior that doesn’t seem optimal. To make sense why this happens, you can use the inefficient coordination game. It may apply to implementing the metric system <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> versus the obscure English system of measurements <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">. If both parties agree on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">, they get a payoff of 2. If both agree on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">, they get a payoff of 1. If they differ, they get a payoff of 0. If both parties were free to choose they would agree on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">, but in England people are stuck with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">.</p>
<p>How do you get inefficiency? The metric system wasn’t around when the English measurements were made up. Situations can shift. This can be explained with the shake-bow game. Greeting people is a coordination game. It is important that we greet people the same way. If one shakes and the other bows, eyes get poked out. If both shake hand, they get a payoff of 1. If one shakes and one bows, we both get 0. If both bow, bot get a payoff of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">.</p>
<p>The question is: which is better, bowing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%3E%201"> or shaking <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%3C%201">? Shaking could be better than bowing because people can get a sense of the other’s general health by feeling. However, recently the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> has increased because people now travel all over the world in airplanes with germs over the seats and touching these seats spreads germs all over the hands. And then bowing is better than shaking because the world has changed. As a result, countries that are shaking could get stuck in a suboptimal way of greeting, just like England is stuck in a suboptimal system of measurements.</p>

<section id="sec-emergence-of-culture" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-emergence-of-culture">Emergence of culture</h2>
<p>To understand why cultures differ, the pure coordination game is extended to multiple games. Culture is the result of lots of coordination games. Here are some example questions. Do people wear shoes in your house? Do you cross the street when the “don’t walk” sign is flashing? Do you read the newspaper at the breakfast table or are you talking to people? Do you hug your friends when you see them? And do you interrupt someone who’s talking?</p>
<p>Each of these situations is a pure coordination game. If everybody else is wearing shoes in the house, you don’t want to take your shoes off cause you will get dirt all over your feet. If you are walking with friends, and they don’t cross the street when the sign is flashing and you do, then they will be standing on one side of the street and you will be standing on the other. If you read the newspaper at the breakfast table and the other person is hoping to engage in conversation, he is going to stare at your newspaper. If you’re in a culture where people don’t interrupt and somebody interrupts you, this disrupts the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>People that give the same answers to these questions are culturally similar. If there are 20 coordination games with two possible answers to each, then you have 220 or more than 1,000,000 possible cultures. There are of course more coordination games, and many of them have more than two answers, so there are many more possible cultures. Why do cultures differ? The paradoxical answer is they differ because everyone is trying to coordinate. People are trying to coordinate within a culture most likely on issues that are different than those in others cultures.</p>

</div></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod">Robert Axelrod’s</a> culture model <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelrod1997DisseminationofCulture">(Axelrod 1997)</span> explains how cultures emerge, and why there are boundaries between cultures. Axelrod defines a set of features which are coordination games like whether you read the newspaper at the table or talk. Traits define what action you take on that feature, e.g.&nbsp;talk. There could be multiple options. A person is a vector of traits on features. For instance, person A wears shoes in the house, stores ketchup in the fridge, and reads the newspaper at the table.</p>

<figcaption>Social space</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Axelrod then puts people in social space that could be represented by a grid of boxes that represent people. The last assumption Axelrod makes, is that people interact with their four direct neighbors in the grid with a probability that is equal to the similarity between them. This interaction works like a coordination game.</p>
<p>If you don’t agree on much with your neighbor then you don’t interact and don’t change your behavior. If you agree on everything then you interact for sure, but then you don’t have to change anything. If you agree for 70% of the traits, then you randomly pick a feature, and then match the trait of that person. It could be you already match that person on that trait, but if you don’t then you will switch and match.</p>

<figcaption>Axelrod’s game</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This can be worked out using a model. Suppose there are five features, ten values, four neighbors (North, South, East, West), and the similarity is the percentage of traits that a person agrees with the another person. When two people meet, one of them is a leader while the other is a follower. e.g., the leader may have the characteristics 53211 and the follower 51331.</p>
<p>The probability these two people are going to interact is 40% because they agree on two traits out of five. If they decide to interact, then then they decide play a coordination game on one of the traits, e.g.&nbsp;the second trait. The follower then matches this trait to the leader so that his characteristics become 53311.</p>

</div></div>
<p>This can be simulated using NetLogo. In this example there are five features and twelve traits. In the centre of each square is a person. The thickness of the boundary represents the number of treats those two people agree on and thus the likelihood they will interact. If that line is dark, there is little agreement, and if it’s lighter, there is more agreement and a higher probability of interaction.</p>
<p>Over time the number of regions are falling and the cultures are becoming more similar. The largest region is also growing but there is still some cultural <strong>heterogeneity</strong>. And if we let it run till it stops, you get a few separate cultures and there are thick boundaries around them. They have to have these thick boundaries because if they didn’t, people would interact with their neighbors across those boundaries and become similar.</p>
<p>Axelrod’s model shows that similar regions emerge, so that you get multiple cultures, but the boundaries between those cultures are thick. Axelrod then concludes that if our neighbors are like us, we tend to interact with them, and if they are not, we tend not to. This produces distinct cultures with thick boundaries or vast differences between these cultures. Thick boundaries emerge because of the fact that if there weren’t thick, then people would interact and become more similar so that the boundary would disappear. Axelrod’s model shows how distinct cultures on multi dimensions can emerge with self-reinforcing boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-coordination-and-consistency">Coordination and consistency</h2>
<p>Axelrod’s model leaves out the notion of consistency within a culture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bednar">Jenna Bednar</a> developed a model of culture based on coordination games that includes <strong>coherence</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> as well as the <strong>heterogeneity</strong> within cultures. In Ron Inglehart’s World Value Survey, there are a lot of consistencies across countries, e.g.&nbsp;Protestant Europe looks the same, Catholic Europe looks the same and the Islamic countries look the same. On the other hand, everybody hasn’t the same characteristics. e.g., people in Sweden differ. And the same is true for Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>To explain why there is consistency and <strong>heterogeneity</strong> within a culture we assume that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the values, actions, and behaviors that people coordinate on have some meaning;<br>
</li>
<li>people desire some consistency, e.g.&nbsp;to avoid cognitive dissonance;<br>
</li>
<li>there is some innovation and errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The coordination rule is that two people, that each have a vector of actions, beliefs or attitudes, meet, and the follower randomly picks a dimension, and coordinates on this dimension, e.g.&nbsp;he puts the ketchup where his friend puts the ketchup. Consistency would be this that a person looks at himself, and attribute values of the vector have meaning. e.g., a person with characteristics 5144 might think, I’m 5 on the first and 1 on the second, and that doesn’t make sense, so I switch and become 5 on the second. And so the characteristics of this person become 5544.</p>
<p>e.g., you come from a family that is pretty reserved, so you don’t even hug your parents very often, and have hugging behavior 1. Then you go to college and all your friends hug each other. Now you have hugging behavior 5 with your friends. When you go home you realise you have been hugging someone you just met a month ago to say good-bye so you start hugging your mother and change your behavior to 5. If you hug your friends, you might as well hug your mother. In this way you become more consistent in terms of how you behave.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>If we assume that people try to coordinate with other people, and try to be consistent, it could be expected to lead to consistent coordinated behavior. It happened but the process took an incredibly long time to converge. When some tiny errors or innovations were introduced, then there were big spreads in the characteristics of individuals like those in Sweden and Zimbabwe. Only a small number of people have to try new things, to get that level of <strong>heterogeneity</strong> within a community.</p>
<p>That was a surprising result. The question is why? Suppose the model converges to everybody being 5 on everything and somebody decides to innovate a bit and change to 6 on one thing. We might think that this should go away because people try to be consistent with themselves or meet somebody else so that it gets corrected to 5.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that during an interaction somebody else copies the 6 or that people themselves switch other attributes to 6 in order to be more consistent. In this way the six can spread within a person (horizontally in the graph) and across people (vertically in the graph). If more of such innovations or errors are made, e.g.&nbsp;switching to 7, these can also spread. This means the process isn’t going to converge very fast. There is a lot of spread because errors propagate in many directions. Most traits are going to be fives, but there will be sixes and sevens everywhere.</p>
<p>It is possible to mathematically understand why small amounts of error can cause a big spread. The simplest model consists of two agents, two games, and two actions. e.g.&nbsp;two people are deciding whether to hug or bow with their family, or hug or bow with their friends. Now it is possible to write down all possible states of the world. The columns represent the games. The rows represent the persons.</p>

</div></div><p>The following could happen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>both do the same thing on both games, e.g.&nbsp;action red;<br>
</li>
<li>one person is taking one action on both games, but the other person is taking the other action one game, which is called off by one;<br>
</li>
<li>they could be consistent but not coordinated, e.g.&nbsp;one person is green on both, and the other person is red on both;<br>
</li>
<li>they could be coordinated but not consistent, e.g.&nbsp;they could both play the red action on one game and the green action on the other game, but they would have a lot of cognitive dissonance because neither one is consistent;<br>
</li>
<li>they could be not coordinated and not consistent, which could be a total mess.</li>

<figcaption>Consistency dynamic</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>If this system is without an error, the dynamics can be described. e.g., in the state where people are off by one, the consistency dynamic is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>person 2 could look at himself, check for consistency, and conclude that he is consistent, and nothing would change;<br>
</li>
<li>person 1 could look at herself, check for consistency, and conclude that she is not consistent, and switch both actions to red. Then both would be consistent, but neither would be coordinated;<br>
</li>
<li>person 2 could look at herself, check for consistency, and conclude that she is not consistent, and switch both actions to green. If person 1 finds herself to be inconsistent, then there is a 50% chance for (2) to happen as well as a 50% chance for (3) to happen.</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>Transition map</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>It is also possible to write down the coordination dynamic for all the different states including the probability of moving from those states to other states. e.g., if there is a total mess (top), and one of the persons looks at himself or herself and decides to become consistent, then they move to the off by one state (centre). Alternatively, suppose that two people may decide to coordinate. Then again, they move to the off by one state. No matter what happens, with probability they move from the total mess state to the off by one state.</p>
<p>In the off by one state (centre), a lot could happen. They could stay in the off by one state, e.g.&nbsp;when person 2 looks at himself and decides that he is consistent, or if these two people decide to coordinate on action 1. Alternatively, it would be possible to move over to the state consistent but not coordinated (right) or coordinated but not consistent (bottom). Finally, they could move to the coordinated and consistent state (left). This is the only state that is stable because they will not move out.</p>

<figcaption>Markov process</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This is like a Markov process, except that they can’t get from any state to any other state because they can get stuck in the equilibrium coordinated and consistent state. If there is innovation or error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%B5"> then they can move back to the off by one state and then it is a Markov process.</p>
<p>In this way it becomes possible to write a matrix we with the horizontal axis representing the states at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and the vertical axis representing the states at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t+1">. The cells represent the odds of moving from one state to the other. This model shows that small innovation rates lead to substantial <strong>heterogeneity</strong>. This was a big surprise.</p>
<p>There are differences between cultures, so people from France behave differently than people from Mexico. There are also see similarities within, meaning that people within an interacting group become similar. Their behavior isn’t identical and there is a lot of within-group <strong>heterogeneity</strong>, e.g.&nbsp;in Sweden or Zimbabwe. Some of that behavior is interesting in the sense that it doesn’t appear to be optimal from the outside. e.g., people might do 5 to become consistent, even though it is not optimal.</p>
<p>There are three ways people can coordinate on a wrong action:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>by <strong>idiosyncratic coordination</strong> on the wrong thing.</li>
<li>payoffs can change over time, e.g.&nbsp;with bowing versus shaking hands.</li>
<li>to <strong>maintain consistency</strong>, people could choose a behavior that is not optimal in one domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Culture can be seen as multiple coordination games, where people are trying be consistent. To get good outcomes, it’s important to coordinate behavior, e.g.&nbsp;to greet people the same way. There is still a lot of within-group <strong>heterogeneity</strong> that could be explained by assuming that there is a small amount of error and experimentation as errors propagate in two directions. This could be shown using a Markov model.</p>
<p>Pure coordination behavior creates a Lyapunov function so this process converges quickly.</p>
<p>If we include consistency and error then we no longer have a Lyapunov function , but we could use a Markov model.</p>
<p>The Lyapunov model and the Markov model can be used to explain other models like the culture model.</p>
<p>Even though culture is complex, simple models allow us to understand some basic properties of cultures, such as difference between cultures, consistency within cultures, and <strong>heterogeneity</strong> within cultures.</p>

<section id="sec-lyapunov-functions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-lyapunov-functions">Lyapunov Functions</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a> map models into outcomes. We can take a model or a system and ask whether there is a Lyapunov function that describes that model or system. If that is possible, then that system goes to equilibrium. If we can’t construct a Lyapunov function, then the type of outcome can be of any class. e.g., in physics you might have a velocity function over time, and if the velocity changes then it goes down with at least some minimum amount, and there is a minimum velocity, e.g.&nbsp;zero. Those conditions mean that the system has to stop at some point.</p>
<p>This can be formalised as follows. There is a Lyapunov function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(x)">, and the system has to stop and go to equilibrium at some point meaning that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_%7Bt+1%7D%20=%20x_t">, if the following conditions hold:<br>
1. it has a maximum value (or a minimum value if it is going down);<br>
2. there is a <em>k &gt; 0</em> such that, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_%7Bt+1%7D%20%5Cne%20x_t"> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(x_t+1)%20%3E%20F(x_t)%20+%20k"> (or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(x_%7Bt+1%7D)%20%3C%20F(x_t)%20-%20k"> if it is going down).</p>
<p>The change must be of some minimum amount <em>k</em> because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s Arrow paradox</a> that states if you go halfway the remaining route every day, you will never arrive at your destination as you travel smaller distances every day. If you know the minimum amount <em>k</em> then you know the maximum number of steps. e.g., if <em>k</em> is a quarter of the total distance then the maximum number of steps is 4. The tricky part is construction the Lyapunov function <em>F(x)</em>. Sometimes it is easy, sometimes it is hard, and sometimes it is impossible to do.</p>

<section id="sec-the-organization-of-cities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-the-organization-of-cities">The organization of cities</h2>
<p>In any major city there is an amazing order. Restaurants have the right number of people in them, so do coffee shops. There are not huge lines behind dry cleaners. The interesting thing is that there is no central planner and the city self-organises in some way so that the right number of people are at the right places and there are no vacancies or crowds at particular points. What makes the city organise in this way?</p>
<p>Suppose that there are five locations everyone has to go to each week, which are the cleaners <em>C</em>, the grocery <em>G</em>, the deli <em>D</em>, the book store <em>B</em> and the fish market <em>F</em>, and there are five days to do them, which are Monday <em>Mo</em>, Tuesday <em>Tu</em>, Wednesday <em>We</em>, Thursday <em>Th</em> and Friday <em>Fr</em>. Assume that individuals choose their order of visiting those places randomly. A route that someone might take during the week is: <em>(Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr) =&gt; (C, G, B, D, F)</em>. Suppose there are five people that choose some random order to visit these locations. Assume that the behaviour of these people is to switch two locations as to avoid crowds.</p>
<p>If people follow these rules, then we can use the Lyapunov function on the process, and show that it goes to equilibrium. Assume those five people picked the following routes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>(C, G, D, B, F)</em>,</li>
<li><em>(G, C, D, B, F)</em>,</li>
<li><em>(C, D, G, F, B)</em>,</li>
<li><em>(C, B, F, G, D)</em>,</li>
<li><em>(C, F, D, B, G)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each week one person switches locations to avoid other people, and takes the most efficient step, meaning that he or she makes the switch that avoids the most people. After one week person 1 might then switch <em>C</em> and <em>F</em>, meaning that the next week he is going to the fish market on Monday and to the cleaners on Friday to avoid crowds at the cleaners.</p>
<p>Finding a Lyapunov function might be a form of trial and error. e.g., you may try the total number of people at each location per week. That doesn’t work out because the total number of people will always be 5. Another option is the number of people that the five people meet each week. In the first week person 1 meets 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 people. If this person switches the cleaners and the fish market, he will meet 4 people next week because the others don’t switch. Consequently, those others don’t meet person 1 at the cleaners too, so the total number of meetings in that week drops by 8.</p>
<p>This is a Lyapunov function because there is a minimum of 0 meetings during a week and people keep switching until there are no options to reduce the number of meetings. When that happens, the system enters into equilibrium. The value of <em>k</em> is 2 because if a person avoids meeting another person, this other person also meets one less person. This explains why cities are self-organizing because people develop routines to avoid crowds. This model is simplistic, because people move, businesses start and stop, and more people may decide to change their route simultaneously. That is going to keep a city churning and somewhat complex.</p>

<section id="sec-exchange-economies-and-externalities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-exchange-economies-and-externalities">Exchange economies and externalities</h2>
<p>An exchange market has a Lyapunov function and therefore goes to equilibrium. There are other sorts of markets that don’t go to equilibrium. It is sometimes possible to see why is that the case. What prevents us from constructing a really simple Lyapunov function and showing that the system goes to equilibrium is related to Chris Langton’s lambda used in the one-dimensional cellular automata models.</p>
<p>An exchange market consists of a situation where people just bring stuff, e.g.&nbsp;fish, baskets or money, and trade these things. The question is whether that system goes to an equilibrium, or are people just going to keep on trading things throughout the day? The assumptions for the model of the exchange market are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>each person brings in an amount of stuff;<br>
</li>
<li>people only trade if this increases their happiness at least with some fixed amount <em>k</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This fixed amount of <em>k</em> represents effort or transaction costs to make the trade. That is important for the Lyapunov function to work. A possible Lyapunov function could be the total happiness of the people. There is a maximum amount of happiness to be derived from a fixed amount of stuff. There is also some fixed amount <em>k</em> of transaction costs such that, if the process doesn’t stop, happiness goes up by at least <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>If North Korea and Iraq exchange nuclear weapons for oil, then both countries would probably be more happy as Iraq has nuclear weapons and North Korea has oil. The United States, China, and many other countries, who were not part of the transaction, probably are not so pleased, so total happiness may not have increased with this trade. If total happiness went down, that may mean that other people then have to make other trades as they try and make total happiness go up.</p>
<p>In that case we don’t know for sure whether the system is ever going to stop because we can’t put a Lyapunov function on the process. It may happen in political coalitions or firms merging. When party A merges with Party B, then party C may be upset, and total happiness may not be going up. The same is true with political alliances between countries. They could make other countries less secure. And that could mean that there is no Lyapunov function.</p>
<p>When two people decide to date, they are both happier. Or when two people break up, presumably they are both happier. But that could affect other people who are friends of those people, who maybe wanted to date one of those people, and it’s not clear. Maybe dating has a Lyapunov function, maybe happiness is a Lyapunov function for dating, maybe it’s not. It depends on the size of the externalities.</p>
<p>That can be related to Langton’s lambda parameter from the simple cellular automata model. The cellular automata model tells that systems where behavior isn’t influenced by others, tend to go to equilibrium, while systems where behavior is influenced by others, tend to be complex or random. Similarly, we can apply a Lyapunov function where someone’s actions don’t materially affect others, or if they do, they make them happier, meaning that there are no negative externalities.</p>

<section id="sec-time-to-convergence-and-optimality" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-time-to-convergence-and-optimality">Time to convergence and optimality</h2>
<p>There are two questions to Lyapunov functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How long does the process take to go to an equilibrium?<br>
</li>
<li>Does the process always stop at the minimum or the maximum?</li>
</ol>
<p>How long does the process take to go to an equilibrium? If the process stops, it is in equilibrium. If it doesn’t stop, then its value according to increases by at least <em>k</em>. Since there’s a maximum, that means that at some point the process has to stop. Suppose that we start out with <em>F(x1) = 100</em>, and <em>k = 2</em>, and the maximum is 200 then the number of periods has to be equal or less than 50.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>Does the process always stop at the minimum or the maximum? Generally a process can get stuck someplace less than the max. That can be explained in two ways. First, it is possible using a model. The rugged landscape model has multiple peaks. A Lyapunov function can be seen as taking steps up at least some distance each period, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that this is leading to the highest peak.</p>
<p>A second way is an actual example rather than an abstract model like a rugged landscape. Assume there are three persons, numbered 1, 2, and 3. The graph shows their preferences and they all own the item in the middle column of their corresponding row. Person 1 owns a banana prefers apples to bananas and bananas to coconuts.</p>
<p>Assume that there is an exchange market. Person 1 likes the apple of person 3, but if he offers the banana to person 3, she refuses. Person 2 likes the banana of person 1 but can’t trade the coconut for it. Similarly, person 3 cannot trade his apple for the coconut of person 2. None of them can make a pair wise trade and be better off.</p>

<section id="sec-lyapunov-fun-and-deep" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-lyapunov-fun-and-deep">Lyapunov: fun and deep</h2>
<p>Lyapunov functions are one technique for determining whether or not a system goes to equilibrium. But can we always tell, possibly with the help of other techniques? The question is does the system go to equilibrium or does it not, and can we even tell? We are going to do this in a fun way with some examples and then we will go a little bit deeper. We will see why some processes are very hard to figure out.</p>
<p>The fun example is called chairs and offices. A firm is moving to new offices with different types of chairs. An employee, who followed this course, suggests to distribute furniture by randomly assigning each person a chair and then let people trade. The boss thinks that it is not a good idea. But the employee says that at some point the process will stop because the process consists of an exchange market and a Lyapunov function of how happy people are with their chairs. With every trade happiness goes up. People will stop trading if they are satisfied, because it takes time and effort to trade.</p>
<p>Then the boss also wants to do this for offices and randomly assign people offices and then let them trade. Then the employee said that is a terrible idea. The student says, the office is different because there are externalities. If a person moves because of the habits of another person, e.g.&nbsp;playing loud music, people in the new location may move because of this person’s habits, e.g.&nbsp;wandering around. And so, there will be no increase in total happiness after a move, and the system may not go to equilibrium. Finding this out requires a lot of knowledge about people’s preferences.</p>
<p>That leads to the deep question of when can you decide? And can you always decide? The answer is it depends on the problem. In some cases you can figure out some other way to show or prove that the process goes to equilibrium. In some other cases you can come up with a sophisticated Lyapunov function to show that the system goes to equilibrium. But other problems, even those that seem incredibly simple, turn out to be very hard to solve.</p>
<p>e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz problem</a> or HOTPO (half or three plus one), is that you pick a number, and then do the following. If it is an even number, you divide it by two, if it is an odd number, you multiply it by three and add one. You stop if you reach one. The question is, does this process ever stop? For 5 you get: 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (stop). For 7 you get: 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5 (stops because 5 stops). For 27 and many other numbers the Collatz problem hasn’t been solved yet. So for some numbers we can tell and for some numbers we can’t. For the chair problem we can tell, but for the office problem we can’t.</p>

<p>There are some fundamental differences between the equilibria with Lyapunov functions and equilibria with Markov processes. Both Markov processes and Lyapunov functions give conditions under which we can determine that a system is going to equilibrium.</p>
<p>A Lyapunov function <em>F</em> has a maximum value. If the process isn’t in equilibrium then it goes up by at least some fixed amount <em>k</em>. This has to stop at some point. A Markov process has a finite number of states, and if the probability of moving between those states stays fixed over time, and it is possible to get from any one state to any other, and it is not a simple cycle, the Markov convergence theorem states that the system goes to a unique equilibrium distribution that doesn’t depend on the initial state.</p>
<p>This is a stochastic equilibrium so the system is still churning. In a Markov process, history doesn’t matter. A Lyapunov function could depend a lot on the initial conditions. There could be many equilibria depending on where you start and where you go. It’s also not a stochastic equilibrium. It is a fixed point.</p>
<p>If you can construct a Lyapunov function, then the system goes to equilibrium. If you can’t, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t. If you can write down a Lyapunov function, you can figure out how long it’s going to take to reach equilibrium. A Lyapunov equilibrium needs not be unique or efficient. The reason a Lyapunov system won’t go equilibrium is because of externalities pointing in the other direction.</p>
<p>That is the same lesson we learned from the Langton’s lambda in the simple cellular automata model. When one person’s action or one cell’s action depends on the actions of others, the system’s likely to churn. When what I do is unaffected by other people, then the system is likely to go to equilibrium.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-markov-chain-models">Markov Chain models</h2>
<p>Markov models consist of entities that can be in a set of states and there are transition probabilities between those states. e.g., there is a set of students. Those students could be in either one of two states, alert or bored. There is some probability P that they move from alert to bored and some probability Q that they move from bored to alert. Over time these students are moving back and forth from the alert state to the bored state. The Markov process gives us a framework to understand how those dynamics take place.</p>

<figcaption>Historical trend of freedom in countries</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This can also be applied to countries being free, being partially free or not free. Historically there are different trends. The free states seem to be increasing. The not-free tend to be decreasing. The Markov process can be used to figure out where this is going to end up.</p>
<p>The Markov convergence theorem state that, as long as a couple of assumptions hold, namely that there is a finite number of states, and the transition probabilities stay fixed, and you can get from any state to any other state, then the system goes to equilibrium. This is a really powerful finding that has all sorts of implications.</p>
<p>To understand Markov processes, matrices can be used. Matrices are grids of numbers. Those numbers will be the transition probabilities. Multiplication by matrices is used to understand Markov processes and the Markov convergence theorem. These matrices can be used to explain why these systems go to equilibria.</p>
<p>Markov processes are interesting for two reasons. First, Markov processes are a useful way to think about how the world works and this gives powerful results The Markov convergence theorem says that these systems are going to equilibria. Second, is the idea of exaptation. That the Markov model is incredibly fertile and can be applied in a whole range of different settings. Transition probabilities and matrices can also be used in a lot of settings as well.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-a-simple-markov-model">A simple Markov model</h2>
<p>Let’s use the simple example of alert and bored students. Some percentage of the students are alert and some percentage of the students are bored. An alert student can switch and become bored and a bored student can switch and become alert. We need to assume something about the transition probabilities. Assume that in any given period, 20% of the alert students become bored, but 25% of the bored students become alert. Here the matrices will be useful.</p>
<p>We can calculate this by hand. Assume we start with 100 alert and 0 bored, so (A,B)-&gt;(100,0). After one period, you have 80 alert and 20 bored, so (A,B) -&gt; (100-20+0=80, 0-0+20=20). If you go on then (A,B) -&gt; (80-16+5=69, 20+16-5=31). This is rather complicated so there must be a better way to keep track of this.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>The Markov transition matrix gives the probabilities of moving from state to state. The columns tell what is true at time <em>t</em> and the rows tells what is true at time <em>t+1</em>. So if you’re alert at time <em>t</em>, there’s an 80% chance you stay alert, and a 20% chance you become bored. If you’re bored at time <em>t</em>, there’s a 25% chance you become alert and a 75% chance that you stay bored.</p>

</div></div>
<p>The calculation process works as follows. For each row you multiply the elements with the value at <em>t</em> to get the value at <em>t+1</em>. So <em>A(t+1) = 0.8A(t) + 0.25B(t)</em> and <em>B(t+1) = 0.2A(t) + 0.75B(t)</em>. It is possible to repeat these steps. The result after six periods is that only 58% of the students are alert.</p>
<p>Where does this process stop? It is possible to do the same calculation starting with all students being bored. After 6 turns 53% is alert and 47% is bored. It looks like there is an equilibrium.</p>

<figcaption>Markov equilibrium matrix</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>So how do we calculate the equilibrium? The equilibrium would mean that at <em>t+1</em> the same percentage of people is alert as at <em>t</em>. So <em>0.8p + 0.25(1-p) = p =&gt; p/5 = (1-p)/4 =&gt; (4/5)p = 1 - p =&gt; (9/5)p = 1 =&gt; p = 5/9</em>. So in equilibrium 5/9 will be alert and 4/9 will be bored. In that case 20% of the alert will get bored, which is 1/9, and 25% of the bored will become alert, which is also 1/9.</p>
<p>This is a stochastic equilibrium. The thing that doesn’t change is the probability. The population is still moving from alert to bored and from bored to alert.</p>

</div></div><p>A slightly more complicated model involves countries that can either be free, partly free or not free at all. This can be used to learn how Markov processes work, how they can be extended to more dimensions. Let’s start simply with just a two-state model with democracies and dictatorships. Assume that 5% of democracies become dictatorships every decade, and that 20% of dictatorships become democracies.</p>
<p>Let’s start off by assuming 30% are democracies and 70% are dictatorships. After a decade, (0.95 * 0.3 + 0.2 * 0.7) * 100% = 42.5% are going to be democracies while 57.5% will be dictatorships. One decade later, 52% will be democracies and 48% will be dictatorships. The equilibrium can also be calculated. <em>0.95p + 0.2(1-p) = p =&gt; 1/5 - p/5 = p/20 =&gt; p/4 = 1/5 =&gt; p = 4/5</em>. The surprising finding is that we only end up with 80% democracies even though 95% of democracies stay democracies and 20% of dictatorships become democracies in each decade.</p>

<figcaption>Democracy Markov model</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>A sophisticated model is having three categories, free, partly free, and not free. This data comes from Freedom House and shows an increase in free countries and a decrease in not free countries, and a slight decrease in partly free countries. What is likely to happen?</p>
<p>You can use five year increments, use transition probabilities, and do some crude estimates. This results in the following. Each decade, 5% of free, and 15% of not free become partly free. And 5% of not free and 10% of partly free become free. And 10% of partly free become not free.</p>
<p>This is a three by three matrix. With computers it is possible to make a huge matrices and solve them for equilibrium. So what does that equilibrium look like? All we do is take each one of these rows, and multiply by the columns. The algebra results in 62.5% of countries being free, 25% being partly free, and 12.5% being not free, presuming that the transition probabilities stay fixed.</p>
<p>The model shows some general trends. The graph generated from the model doesn’t look exactly the same as the real picture, but it doesn’t look bad either. The model comes up at the end of the 40 year period with values that are close to those in the real world but that is because the estimated transition probabilities were based on the actual data. What’s more interesting is that the patterns look fairly similar as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-markov-convergence-theorem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-markov-convergence-theorem">Markov convergence theorem</h2>
<p>The Markov convergence theorem tells that, provided a few fairly mild assumptions are met, Markov processes converge to a stochastic equilibrium. There are movements, but the probability of being in each state stays fixed. The conditions that must hold for that to be true are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a finite number of states</li>
<li>fixed transition probabilities</li>
<li>eventually you can get from any state to any other state<br>
</li>
<li>not a simple cycle</li>
</ol>
<p>If these conditions hold then a Markov process converges to an equilibrium distribution that is unique, which means that there is only one equilibrium distribution that is independent of the initial state. It is determined entirely by the transition probabilities. In Markov processes, the initial state, history, and interventions to change the state have no effect on the long run on the system.</p>
<p>Interventions can have effect. First, it could take a long time before the system is back to equilibrium so that an intervention may have a significant benefit. Second, some of the conditions of the theorem may not hold in the real world, most notably the fixed transition probabilities. The transition probabilities may change over time as the function of the state of the system. Changing the state has a temporary effect, but changing the transition probabilities has permanent consequences. Useful interventions change the transition probabilities. This may happen to tipping points.</p>

<section id="sec-expectation-of-the-markov-model" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-expectation-of-the-markov-model">Expectation of the Markov model</h2>
<p>The Markov model can be used in contexts and problems we never would have thought of. The first way is taking the entire process and modelling to other things. The second way is using a part of the Markov model, the transition probability matrix, to understand some things that are surprising and interesting. A Markov process is. Fixed set of states with fixed transition probabilities between those states. If it is possible to get from any state to any other through a sequence of transitions, then the Markov convergence theorem states that the process is going to a unique equilibrium.</p>
<p>This can be applied to voter turnout. Assume that there is a set of voters at time <em>t</em>, and there is a set a of non-voters at time <em>t</em>. We can make a transition matrix of that to find out how many are going to vote at time <em>t+1</em>, and how many are not going to vote at time <em>t+1</em>. If the transition probabilities stay fixed then there is a unique equilibrium that tells the number of people that is expected to vote in any election. This can also be applied to school attendance as each day there are children that go to school and children that don’t go to school. These two applications are very standard.</p>

<figcaption>Identify writer</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>It is also possible to use only a part of the Markov model, the Markov transition matrix, to identify writers. The transition matrix can be used to figure out who wrote a book. So suppose some anonymous person wrote a book and you are trying to figure out whether Bob or Elisa wrote it.</p>
<p>You can figure out transition probabilities by taking some key words, and then create transition matrices. e.g., you can calculate at what percentage of the time does “the record”, “example” or “the sake of” of follow the word “for”. You can compare this with books Bob and Elisa wrote with the use of computers.</p>
<p>This can be applied to medical diagnosis and treatment. Typically, there’s a sequence of reactions to that treatment. You can write down transition probabilities that can be multi-stage. e.g., if the treatment is going to be successful, the patient goes through the following transitions: first pain, then feeling slightly depressed, then some more pain, but then the patient gets better. Alternatively, if the treatment is not successful, it could be that, initially the patient is depressed, then there is mild pain, then there’s no pain, and then the treatment fails. This can be used to figure out early on whether or not a treatment will be successful.</p>
<p>Another example is the road to war. Suppose there are two countries and there is some tension. The political process goes through the following transitions. First there are some political statements on each side, then that leads to trade embargoes, followed by military buildup. Based on this sequence of three events, you estimate the likelihood of war based on historical data of previous times when those three transitions happened.</p>
<p>In these cases we are not using the full power of the Markov model and we do not assume that the transition probabilities necessarily stay fixed. We are not interested in solving for the equilibrium. All we’re trying to do is just use this probability matrix to organize the data in such a way that we can think more clearly about what’s likely to happen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-problem-solving-and-innovation">Problem solving and innovation</h2>
<p>There are several issues regarding to problem solving, e.g.&nbsp;how individuals and teams go about solving problems, the role of diversity in problem solving, how ideas can get recombined, and how a lot of innovation actually comes from somebody having an idea in one place and it being applied someplace else. The two main themes are the role of diversity and the power of recombination.</p>
<p>We can model problem solving in a formal fashion. Assume that you take some action <em>a</em> and there is a payout function <em>F</em>, that gives the value of that action <em>F(a)</em>. e.g., <em>a</em> could be a health care policy, and <em>F</em> could be how efficient this health care policy is. So <em>a</em> is the solution that you propose and <em>F(a)</em> is how good the solution is.</p>
<p>We want to understand how people come up with better solutions, hence where innovation comes from. For this, we use the metaphor of a landscape as a lens through which to interpret our models. Each solution has a value and the altitude can be seen as the value of it. Here B is the best possible solution. Assume that I have some idea <em>X</em>, which is represented by the black dot. It may be a good idea.</p>
<p>I might be looking for better ideas by going up and down the slope. In this way I well arrive at <em>C</em> and here I will get stuck. What we want to see is how people come up with these ideas, how teams of people come up with better ideas, and how we can avoid getting stuck on C, and possibly get to B. How do we model this?</p>
<p>The first part of the model is perspectives. A perspective is how you represent or encode a problem. So if someone poses some problem to you, whether it is software code, designing a bicycle, or a health care policy, you have some way of representing that problem in your head. Once you have encoded the problem, you can create a metaphorical landscape with a value for each possible solution. Different perspectives give different landscapes.</p>
<p>The second part of the model is heuristics. Heuristics define how you move on the landscape. Hill climbing is one heuristic. Random Search would be another heuristic. Different perspectives and different heuristics allow people to find a better solutions to problems. Individuals have perspectives and heuristics.</p>
<p>Teams of people are better in solving problems than the individuals in it because they have more tools, and those tools tend to be diverse. They have different perspectives and different heuristics, and all that diversity makes them better at coming up with new solutions and better solutions to problems.</p>
<p>Recombination means that solutions for different problems from different people can be combined to produce even better solutions for those problems. Sophisticated products like a houses, automobiles and computers consist of all sorts of solutions to sub-problems. By recombining solutions to sub-problems we get ever better solutions, and that is really a big driver of innovation, and growth depends on sustained innovation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-perspectives-and-innovation">Perspectives and innovation</h2>
<p>When you think about a problem, a perspective is how you represent it. Landscape is a way to represent the solutions along the horizontal axis and the value of these solutions as the height. The landscape metaphor can be formalized into a model. In this model a perspective is a representation or encoding of the set of all possible solutions. Then we can create our landscape by assigning a value to each one of those solutions. The right perspective depends on the problem.</p>

</div></div><p>e.g., there are different ways of representing a point. The first method is Cartesian, using the horizontal <em>x</em> and vertical <em>y</em> coordinates. The second method is the polar method using the radius <em>r</em> and the angle <em>Θ</em>. The question is which is better? If you want to represent a line, Cartesian may be better. e.g., you could define the line as <em>y = 5</em>. If you want to describe an arc, polar is better.</p>
<p>Perspectives help us find solutions to problems and to be innovative. In the history of science a lot of great breakthroughs, such as Newton’s theory of gravity, are new perspectives on old problems.</p>
<p>e.g., Mendeleev came up with the periodic table, where he represented the elements by atomic weight. In doing so, he found all sorts of structures, e.g.&nbsp;all the metals being lined up in certain columns. He could have organized them alphabetically, but that wouldn’t have made much sense. Atomic weight representation gives a lot of structure. When Mendeleev wrote down all the elements that were around at the time according to atomic weight, there were gaps in his representation. They were eventually found years later. The perspective of atomic weight was useful because it made people look for missing elements.</p>
<p>We use different perspectives all the time. e.g., when evaluating applicants for a job, you might look at competence or achievement in the form of grade point average (GPA), work ethic in the form of thickness of the resume, or creativity as indicated by the colorfulness of the personality. Depending on what you’re hiring for, any one of these might be fine. All these ways of organizing applicants are perspectives.</p>

</div></div><p>Perspectives will determine how hard the problem will be for you using the landscape metaphor. If the landscape is rugged, there are lots of peaks. To formalize this notion of peaks, we define local optima. A local optima is an action <em>a</em> where all neighboring actions have lower values, so that it is a peak on the landscape. So, if you look in all directions, there seems not to be a solution that is better. Better perspectives therefore have fewer local optima.</p>
<p>e.g., I’m tasked with inventing a new candy bar. There are many different options and I want to find the very best one. One way to represent those candy bars might be by the number of calories. In this case there may be three local optima. Alternatively, I might represent those candy bars by masticity, which is chew time. Chew time probably isn’t the best way to look at candy bars so, as a result this produces a landscape with many more peaks.</p>

<figcaption>Mt. Fuji landscape</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>The best perspective would be a Mount Fuji landscape, the ideal landscape that just has one peak. An example of the Mount Fuji landscape, comes from scientific management. Frederick Taylor solved for the optimal size of a shovel.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re shovelling coal and I want to figure out how many pounds of coal can one shovel in a day as a function of the size of the pan. The larger the shovel gets, workers can shovel more coal, until the shovel gets too big and too heavy to lift. The shovel landscape is therefore single peaked and easy to solve. You are only certain to find a solution if the landscape is single peaked. If there are many peaks, you can easily get stuck on some local peak.</p>

<figcaption>Sum to 15</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Herb Simon developed Sum to Fifteen to show people why different ways of representing a problem can make them more easy and make them like Mount Fuji, or can make them really difficult. Sum to fifteen works as follows. There are cards numbered from one to nine face up on a table. There are nine cards numbered from 1 to 9. There are two players. Each person takes turns, taking a card, until all the cards are gone. Possibly it could end sooner. If a player ever holds three cards that add up to exactly 15, he or she wins.</p>

<figcaption>Magic square</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Assume Peter and David play this game. Peter goes first and takes the four. David goes next so he takes the five. Peter then takes the six. David then takes the eight. Eight plus five equals thirteen so that Peter has to take the two. Four plus two is six. So if David doesn’t take the nine, he’s going to lose. But six plus two is eight. So if David doesn’t take the seven, he’s going to lose. In this case Peter has won.</p>
<p>This game can be seen in a different perspective using the magic square where every row, column and diagonal adds up to fifteen. Peter goes first, and takes the four. David goes next, and takes the five. Peter takes the six, which is an odd choice, because now he can’t win. David then takes the eight. Peter blocks him with the two. But now it turns out, either the nine or seven will let Peter win. What game is this? This is tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>Sum to fifteen is just tic-tac-toe, but on a different perspective. If you move the cards into the magic square, you create a Mount Fuji landscape. You make the problem really simple. So a lot of great breakthroughs, like the periodic table, Newton’s Theory of Gravity, are perspectives on problems that turned something really difficult to figure out into something that suddenly made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>In his book The Difference, Professor Page discusses the Savant Existence Theorem, which states that for any problem, there exists some way to represent it, so that it can be turned into a Mount Fuji problem. All you have to do is, is to put the very best solution in the middle, put the worst ones at the end, and line up the solutions in such a way so that you turn it into a Mount Fuji. In order to make the Mount Fuji, you would have to know the solution already. This isn’t a good way to solve problems. But there is such a perspective, and if you change your perspective, you might find it, and in this way you might find the solution 9.</p>
<p>There are a large amount of bad perspectives. With <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> alternatives, you have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N!"> ways to create one dimensional landscapes. Suppose I have just ten alternatives and I want to order them. here’s ten things I could put first, nine things I could put second, eight things I could put third and so on. So there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%20%C3%97%209%20%C3%97%208%20%C3%97%207%20%C3%97%206%20%C3%97%205%20%C3%97%204%20%C3%97%203%20%C3%97%202%20%C3%97%201"> perspectives. Most of those are not very good because they are not going to organise this set of solutions in any useful way. Only a few of them are going to create Mount Fujis. If we just think in random ways, we’re likely to get a landscape that’s so rugged that we’re going to get stuck just about everywhere.</p>

<section id="sec-heuristics" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-heuristics">Heuristics</h2>
<p>Heuristics is about finding solutions to problems once they have been represented in a perspective. A heuristic is a technique in which you look for new solutions. An example is hillclimb, which is moving locally to better points. It is one of many possible heuristics. Heuristics are defined relative to the problem to be solved. e.g., do the opposite is one famous heuristic that’s in a lot of books on how to innovate. It means to do the exact opposite of the existing solution.</p>
<p>e.g., when you go to buy something, the seller tells you the price. Do the opposite would be that the buyer tells the price. A lot of companies have been starting to do exactly this. So Priceline, lets buyers go to hotels and tell them how much they would like to pay to stay at the hotel or to use the airline. Alternatively, companies can go for lower costs or do the opposite, and charge a high price to signal quality. Doing the opposite can sometimes lead to interesting innovations.</p>
<p>Another heuristic is big rocks first. If you have a bucket and a bunch of rocks of various sizes, it is better to put in the big rocks first, because then you have a bigger chance of putting all the rocks in the bucket. The little rocks can fill in the gaps. In his book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey argues that this is one heuristic successful people use. The big rocks represent the important things. It means that you solve the important issues first, and then arrange the solutions of the less important things around them, you will find better solutions 10.</p>
<p>But there is a drawback. There’s a famous theorem in computer science called the no free lunch theory, proved by <a href="">Wolpert</a> and <a href="">McCready</a>. All algorithms that search the same number of points with the goal of locating a maximum value of a function defined on a finite set perform exactly the same when averaged over all possible functions. This means that some of these problems are incredibly hard and some are really easy so that no heuristic is any better than any other.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Covey is wrong. The free lunch theory states that if you look across all problems, no heuristic is better than the other. Covery spent a lot of time in management and he thinks that management problems lend themselves to the big rock search first heuristic. Another way of looking at the free lunch theory is that, unless you know something about the problem being solved, no algorithm or heuristic performs better than any other. Once you know something about the problem, you might decide that big rocks first does a good job in solving it. When you’re digging a hole in the ground then little rocks first may be a better solution.</p>

<figcaption>Combining heuristics</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Diverse heuristics or combining heuristics can be useful in finding solutions to problems. Suppose I have a choice based on two dimensions, e.g.&nbsp;ice creams that have a size and a number of chocolate chips. The heuristic to find the best taste is to look for a better option in horizontal and vertical directions. Another heuristic is to look in diagonal directions. If you combine those heuristics, you check more options and have a better chance of succeeding. Diverse perspectives plus diverse heuristics enable groups of people to find better solutions to problems.</p>

<section id="sec-teams-and-problem-solving" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-teams-and-problem-solving">Teams and problem solving</h2>
<p>Perspectives and heuristics can be used to show why teams of people often can find solutions to problems that individuals can’t. That’s why teams are better. The term teams is used in a very loose sense. e.g., some person invented the toaster. Then somebody else improved it. Then somebody come up with the crumb tray. Then somebody else came up with the automatic shut off. Others came up with further improvements</p>
<p>Why are groups of people better than individuals? Think about the candy bar example. One perspective was based on calories. It had three local peaks. Let’s call them A, B and C. Another landscape based on masticity had five peaks. Let’s call these A, B, D, E and F. These peaks are different than the peaks for the caloric landscape, with the exception of A and B. A is the best possible point. The best possible point has to be a point in every landscape. Mr.&nbsp;Page doesn’t explain why this is so.</p>
<p>The caloric landscape is better than the masticity landscape because it has fewer local optima. The heuristic is just hill climbing. The peaks where people get stuck are A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can assign a value to each of those peaks. Suppose A is the global optimum, and some of these other peaks aren’t so good. We can ask what’s the average value of a peak for the caloric problem solver? It is the average of A, B and C. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%2010,%20B%20=%208%20and%20C%20=%206">, so the average is 8, which is the ability of the caloric problem solver. You can do the same for the masticity problem solver. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%2010,%20B%20=%208,%20D%20=%206,%20E%20=%204,%20F%20=%202"> then this ability is 6.</p>
<p>The caloric problem solver had fewer local optima, but also a higher average, so this is another reason why the caloric problem solver is better. The caloric problem solver may get stuck at B, and then pass the problem on to the masticity problem solver. He will then say that B looks good. If the caloric problem solver gets stuck at C, this point doesn’t look good for the masticity problem solver. This person can get from C to some other local optima. If that is D, E, or F, then it doesn’t look good to the caloric problem solver. Consequently, the team will get stuck at A or B, which is a better outcome. The average is 9, so the ability of the team is 9.</p>
<p>The ability of the team is higher than the ability of either person. This is because the team’s local optima is the intersection of the local optima for the individuals. This is why over time products get better, and why teams are innovative. The reason why a lot of science is done by teams is because the only place a team can get stuck is where everybody on the team can get stuck. This simple model of perspectives and heuristics can explain why teams are better than individuals and why, over time, we keep finding better and better solutions to problems.</p>
<p>The big claim is that the team can only get stuck at a local optima for everyone on the team. That means the team is better than the people in it. Therefore it is better to have people with different local optima, diverse perspectives and diverse heuristics. And that diversity produces different local optima, and those different local optima will mean that the intersections are taken, so that we end up with better points.</p>
<p>What’s missing? This model is highly stylised. Two things are left out. First, there is communication. The model assumed that team members communicate their solutions to one another right away. That is not always the case. There are a lot of misunderstandings and people might not listen. If you make a better product, for instance a better toaster, this could be the way of communicating. Second, There might be an error in interpreting the value of a solution. If a good proposal is made, others can think that it is a bad idea. The model assumes that there is no error in assessing the value of a solution.</p>
<p>In a more advanced model, there could be room for communication error and errant evaluation. That is going to hurt the case for using teams. Even so, this model has shown us something fairly powerful, which is that diverse representations of problems in diverse ways of coming up with solutions can make teams of people better able at coming up with solutions than individuals. And it gave an indication where innovation is coming from. Innovation is coming from different ways of seeing problems and different ways of finding solutions.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-recombination" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-recombination">Recombination</h2>
<p>Until now we focused on individual problems and individual solutions. Recombination is combing a solution or a heuristic to come up with even more solutions or more heuristics. Recombination is an incredibly powerful tool for science, innovation and economic growth. If we have a few solutions or a few heuristics, then we can combine those to create more. The real driving force behind innovation in the economy is that when we come up with a solution and then recombine it with all sorts of other solutions.</p>
<p>e.g., fill in the missing number. 1 2 3 5 _ 13, the missing number is 8, because you add those numbers up, or substract them if you go back. 1 4 _ 16 25 36, the missing number is 9 because it is the square of the next number, which is 3. 1 2 6 _ 1806, the missing number here is 42. The solution is harder to find because you have to combine the first two techniques. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%20-%201%20=%201%20=%201%C2%B2,%206%20-%202%20=%204%20=%202%C2%B2,%2042%20-%206%20=%2036%20=%206%C2%B2,%201806%20-%2042%20=%201764%20=%2042%C2%B2">.</p>
<p>Recombining is a driver of economic growth and also of science because when a new solution can be combined with other solutions. This produces a geometric explosion in the number of possibilities. This may be the reason why it was possible to sustain economic growth by increasing the technology parameter <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>To show how this works, let’s start with finding out how many ways there are to pick three objects from ten. There are 10 I can pick first, 9 I can pick second and 8 I can pick third. 10 * 9 * 8 is too much because picking A, B and C is the same as picking B, A and C. There are three things I can pick first, 2 I can pick second, and 1 I can pick last. Hence, the answer is (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. With far more than 10 solutions, the number is very big. e.g., if you have 52 cards, and you want to combine 20 of them, then the number of combinations becomes (52 * 51 * … * 33) / (20 * 19 * … * 1) ≈ 125,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>This idea of ideas building on ideas is the foundation of the theory of recombinant growth of Martin Weitzman. This theory states that ideas get generated all the time. e.g., the steam engine gets invented and developed, the gasoline engine gets developed, the microprocessor gets developed. And all these things get recombined into interesting combinations. And those combinations, in turn, get recombined to create ever more growth. e.g., many parts in the steam engine were solutions to previous problems. The same applies to the desk top computer.</p>
<p>All those parts of the steam engine weren’t developed the steam engine in mind. They were developed for other purposes. This is an idea from biology called exaptation. The classic example of exaptation, is the feather. Birds developed feathers primarily to keep them warm, but eventually those same feathers allowed them to fly. Expectation means that some innovation for one reason, gets used in another context. Another example is the laser. The laser was not invented with the idea of laser printers in mind. So once something is developed, it gets used for all sorts of unexpected things through the power of recombination.</p>
<p>This also applies to perspectives, e.g.&nbsp;the masticity perspective of a candy bar. Masticity can be a useful perspective for other problems, e.g.&nbsp;pasta or breakfast cereal. So even failed solutions for one problem may work well as a solution to other problems. e.g., the glue in the post it note was originally a failure because the glue didn’t stick very well. But it turned out to be useful for other sorts of problems, mainly making sticky notes.</p>
<p>There is more to it than this. It’s not just the recombination of ideas, because for hundreds and thousands of years people had ideas. There had to be some way to communicate those ideas. In <span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2011gifts">Mokyr (2011)</span> the economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Mokyr">Joel Mokyr</a>, argues that the rise of modern universities, the printing press, and scientific communication allowed ideas to be transferred from one location and one person to another. The technological revolution was driven by the fact that people could share ideas and then recombine them.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-introduction-to-growth">Introduction to growth</h2>
<p>Exponential growth is accumulating over time like interest. It is possible to make primitive models for economic growth. These models show that without innovation, growth stops. Solow’s growth model allows for innovation and shows how innovation has a multiplier effect on our collective well-being. Extensions to these models can be used to explain why some countries are successful while others aren’t, and what enables economic growth.</p>

<figcaption>Comparison Botswana versus Zimbabwe</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>The gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all goods and services produced in an economy. We want to know what causes growth. e.g., Botswana did much better than Zimbabwe. The economists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu">Daron Acemoglu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Robinson">James Robinson</a> wrote a book named <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2012nations">(Acemoglu and Robinson 2012)</span> Why Nations Fail that focuses on the question why some countries like Zimbabwe do so badly.</p>
<p>Economists often talk about real changes in GDP. Real means that inflation is taken into account. The economy is measured in currency, e.g.&nbsp;dollars. If the economy grows by 5% in dollars but the inflation is 3%, then this increased amount of dollars is worth less.</p>
<p>An important question is whether or not super high levels of economic growth are sustainable. China has had growth rates of around 10% for 15 years. Japan had similar growth rates in the 1960s, and they remained high in the 1970s and 1980s. Japan’s growth rates fell after the country caught up with the rest of the world.</p>

<figcaption>Wealth and happiness</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Economic growth often doesn’t look like simple exponential growth. First economic growth can be high, and then it tends to fall. That is because investments are made in machinery and technologies, and they depreciate over time, so that prevents the economic growth curve from becoming exponential. Only innovation can shift the whole curve up.</p>
<p>Economic growth is focused on material things. Does material wealth really matter, in the sense that it makes people happier? That is a complicated question. GDP can be established accurately, but life satisfaction is a soft variable that is difficult to measure. Given these limitations it is possible to construct a graph that shows a few things.</p>
<p>For high income countries, where average incomes are above $20,000, more wealth doesn’t really matter. It does matter for low income countries. Getting from 0 to $10,000 is huge, but getting from $30,000 to $60,000 doesn’t matter a lot. Lifting people out of poverty makes them happier, but becoming richer after that isn’t that important.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-exponential-growth" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-exponential-growth">Exponential growth</h2>
<p>Economic growth models are complex with variables like labour, physical capital, depreciation rates and savings rates, so it is better to start with simple exponential growth like the compounding of interest. The GDP of countries can grow in a similar fashion. This is why different growth rates are so important. The rule of 72 explains how quickly an exponential growing variable will double.</p>

</div></div><p>Exponential growth is simple and like the formula <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x(1%20+%20r)t">. e.g., if you have $100 and 5% interest, you have $105 after one year. After two years it is $110.25. After ten years is is 100*(1 + 0.05)10. You can do the same with GDP. So, if you have a GDP of <em>G</em> and a growth rate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%25"> then GDP after <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> years will be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20*%20(1%20+%20r/100)n">.</p>
<p>So, why are growth rates so important? That is because differences in the growth rate can have dramatic consequences in the long run. This is because this growth is exponential.</p>
<p>The Rule of 72 means that dividing 72 by the growth rate approximately gives you the number of years in which the variable will double. For a growth rate of 2%, the Rule of 72 gives a number of years of 36. The exact number is 35. For 6% growth, the Rule of 72 gives a number of years of 12. So, in 36 years, 6% growth means doubling 3 times, or growing to 8 times the original GDP.</p>
<p>Continuous compounding means that growth is constant and not just at intervals. The formula <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x(1%20+%20r)t"> is just a simplification as if growth only happens once a year. It is possible to calculate interest every day using a formula like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x(1%20+%20r/365)365">, but this doesn’t work for continuous compounding.</p>
<p>For continuous compounding, the interval length approximates zero and the number of intervals approximates infinite. In that case the interest can be calculated using <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clim_%7Bn%20%5Cto%5Cinfty%7D%20(1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Br%7D%7Bn%7D)%5E%7Bn_t%7D%20%20=%20e%5E%7Br_t%7D%0A"> where</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e=%202.71828">.</p>
<p>This is a much simpler formula for growth.</p>

<section id="sec-basic-growth-model" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-basic-growth-model">Basic growth model</h2>
<p>Let’s make a simple growth model. Assume there is a group of workers and a field of coconut trees. When workers pick coconuts they can do two things, which are eating them or they can use the coconuts to build coconut picking machines that can pick coconuts faster but those machines wear out over time and have to be replaced with new machines. This can be used to make a model that explain the role of capital in growth and the limits to that.</p>
<p>Now assume that <em>Lt</em> is the number of workers at time <em>t</em>, <em>Mt</em> is the number of machines at time <em>t</em>, <em>Ot</em> is the output of coconuts at time <em>t</em>, <em>Et</em> is the number of coconuts consumed at time <em>t</em>, <em>It</em> is the number of coconuts invested in machines at time <em>t</em>, <em>s</em> is the savings rate and <em>d</em> is the depreciation rate.</p>
<p>The models has some assumptions. First, the output is increasing and concave in labour and machines, so <em>Ot = √Lt√Mt</em>. Concave means that the first machine is worth more than the second, the second is worth more than the third, and so on. Economists call this diminishing returns to scale. Second, the output is consumed or invested, so <em>Ot = Et + It</em>, where <em>It = sOt</em>. Third, machines can be built, but they depreciate, so <em>Mt+1 = Mt + It - dMt</em>.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/notes-model-thinking/posts/images/mt_fixed_tech_growth.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Basic growth</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Assume that there are 100 workers so the output is <em>Ot = 10√Mt</em>. Assume that the depreciation rate <em>d = 0.25</em> and the savings rate <em>s = 0.3</em>. Assume that we have 4 machines in the first year. The initial output is 10 * √4 = 20. Investment will then be 0.3 * 20 = 6 machines. Depreciation will be 0.25 * 4 = 1 machine. Hence, next year the number of machines will be 4 + 5 = 9, and the output will be 10 * √9 = 30. In that year 9 new machines will be built and 2.25 will be lost due to depreciation. If we round this number to 2, we will have 16 machines the next year and output will be 100 * √16 = 40.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not this growth can continue. That is more easy to see if we consider a big number of machines, for instance 400. Output will be 10 * √400 = 200. Investment will be 60. Depreciation will be 100. Hence, 40 machines will be lost. From this one can conclude that the economy cannot grow this big by itself. Consequently, economic growth must flat out and there must be equilibrium level of GDP.</p>
<p>The long run equilibrium occurs when investment equals depreciation. Now, <em>O = 10√M</em>, <em>I = 3√M</em> and <em>I = M/4</em>. Now <em>3√M = M/4</em>, so <em>12√M = M</em>, so <em>3√M = 12</em>, so <em>M = 144</em>. So, when the number of machines is 144, then depreciation equals investments. In this case output will be 10√144 = 120. In this case investment as well as depreciation will be 36 machines.</p>
<p>The irony of the growth model is that it isn’t really a growth model. Eventually there is no growth. This is because depreciation is linear while output is concave. In this case innovation may bring more growth. That is why innovation is so important.</p>

<section id="sec-solow-growth-model" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-solow-growth-model">Solow growth model</h2>
<p>Without innovation, growth will stop assuming that the amount of labour is fixed. In reality economies continue to grow. The Solow growth model adds another variable to include innovation. In this model <em>Lt</em> is labour at time <em>t</em>, <em>Kt</em> is capital at time <em>t</em>, <em>At</em> is technology at time <em>t</em>, and <em>Ot</em> is output at time <em>t</em>. The model then states that<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AO_t%20%20=%20A_tK_t%5E%7B%5Cbeta%7DL_t%5E%7B1-%5Cbeta%7D%0A"></p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> just states how good the technology is.</li>
<li>If <em>β = 1/2</em> then this is just a square root function as in the basic groth models above. If <em>β &gt; 1/2</em> then capital matters more. If <em>β &lt; 1/2</em> then capital matters less.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous example <em>O = 10√M</em>, <em>I = 3√M</em>, <em>I = M/4</em> and in equilibrium <em>M = 144</em>. If we now introduce an innovation, and the variable for technology <em>A = 2</em>, then <em>O = 20√M</em>, <em>I = 6√M</em>, <em>I = M/4</em> and in equilibrium <em>6√M = M/4</em>, so <em>M = 496</em> and <em>O = 2 * 10 * √496 = 480</em>. The model shows that when productivity doubles, long run GDP becomes 4 times as big. This is because two thing happen. First, the process is becoming more productive. Second, because the process is more productive, it makes sense to invest in more machines.</p>
<p>The innovation multiplier means that if labour and capital become more productive, it makes sense to invest in more capital. <em>A = 3</em>, then <em>O = 30√M</em>, <em>I = 9√M</em>, <em>I = M/4</em> and in equilibrium <em>9√M = M/4</em>, so <em>M = 36²</em> and <em>O = 3 * 10 * √36² = 1080</em>. If we are three times as productive then the total output went up to nine times the initial output. Hence, the effect of innovation is multiplicative.</p>
<p>According to the Solow model, if we continue to innovate and increase our productivity, then growth can continue. This raises the question of where does growth come from? In <em>endogenous growth models</em>, labour can go to picking coconuts to increase capital, but also into investing in new technology in order to increase the parameter <em>A</em>. <em>A</em> can be seen as a choice variable, as a corporation or a country can choose to invest in research an development.</p>

<section id="sec-will-china-continue-to-grow" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-will-china-continue-to-grow">Will China continue to grow?</h2>
<p>In the past Japan had very high growth rates like China has nowadays. The question is can China sustain these levels of economic growth? The growth models show that it is dubious that China can continue to grow this fast unless they have massive increases in technological improvement.</p>
<p>As long as China is catching up with other countries, it is relatively easy to have such high growth levels, but once China has caught up with the rest of the world, it become much harder to sustain high levels of economic growth.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> Growth without innovation</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/notes-model-thinking/posts/images/mt_fixed_tech_growth.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Growth without innovation"></div></div>
<p>How can we work this out in a model. Assume <em>L = 10,000</em>, <em>M = 3,600</em>, <em>s = 0.2 * O</em> and <em>d = 0.1 * M</em>, so <em>O = √10,000 * √3,600 = 6,000</em>. Depreciation will be 360 and investment will be 1,200, so there will be 4,440 machines in the next year. If you calculate this trough, output will be around 6,700 in the next year, a growth of 11%. The year after that, output will be around 7,300, a growth of 9%.</p>
<p>When there are 10,000 machines, output will be 100 * 100 = 10,000, investment 2,000, depreciation 1,000, so there will be 11,000 machines in the next period. Next year, output will be 100√11,000 ≈ 10,500, a growth of 5%. If the number of machines rises, growth falls. If the number of machines is 22,500, output will go from 15,000 to 15,250, and growth will be 1.7%.</p>
<p>China has 8%-10% growth rates for over a decade. China is in the early part of the curve where there is relatively little capital relative to labour. When China is moving further along the curve, it probably will not grow so fast any more. The growth function without innovation is concave. To sustain high growth, China can’t keep on putting more money into capital, and it must innovate. But improvements in technology probably will not be enough to sustain such high levels of growth, and the picture will look like Japan.</p>

<section id="sec-why-do-some-countries-not-grow" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-why-do-some-countries-not-grow">Why do some countries not grow?</h2>
<p>The Solow growth model has labour, capital and technology that are combined to produce output. In this model things like equality and culture are left out. In the book <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2012nations">Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu">Daron Acemoglu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Robinson">James Robinson</a> look over hundreds of years to investigate why some countries are successful and why others are not. e.g., Botswana did very well while Zimbabwe didn’t. Why is that?</p>
<p>Acemoglu and Robinson think that growth requires a <strong>strong central government</strong> to protect capital and investment but that can’t be controlled by a select few. If there is no strong central government to protect property rights, whether it is physical or intellectual property, there is less incentive for people to invest and innovate. And if you have less investment and innovation, you will have lower growth <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2012nations">Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the central government shouldn’t be controlled by a select few like in Zimbabwe. If that is the case then the people in control will extract resources from the economy, often in the form of bribery and corruption. <strong>Extraction</strong> limits growth by lowering investment in innovation and capital. Extraction causes less money to be available for investment as well as less incentive to invest. This has a similar effect as reducing the variable <em>A</em>, and if this variable is reduced to 1/3, output is only 1/9. Syphoning off money from the economy therefore has a multiplier effect 8.</p>

</div></div><p>When <em>A</em> increases, labour becomes more productive. As</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AO_t%20%20=%20A_tK_t%5E%CE%B2L_t%5E%7B1-%CE%B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>, increases in <em>A</em> mean that less labour is required. In a real economy, if less labour is required to produce the same output, this may result in unemployment. In the long run, this is labour is expected to go into producing more capital and innovation, so that there will be more growth and unemployment will disappear again.</p>
<p>What we learn from the model is that growth requires creative destruction, which is a term invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a>. When <em>A</em> increases, whole industries may be wiped out. e.g., when the tractor was invented, blacksmiths were not needed any more.</p>

<figcaption>Ad sales</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Another example of <em>creative destruction</em> happened in the music industry. First there were vinyl records. Then came the cassette tapes. Next were the compact discs. Finally digital singles came up. Newer technologies replaced the older ones.</p>
<p>The American newspaper industry was hurt by people placing ads online. On <a href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> you can post things for sale. This company has really hurt the newspaper industry. The revenue for Craigslist went up while the revenue for the newspaper industry went down as people moved ads from newspapers to Craigslist. Craigslist has more options and it is cheaper, so it is an innovation.</p>
<p>The number of people employed by the newspaper industry dropped from 450,000 in 1988 to 275,000 in 2009. Craigslist only has 23 employees. So 23 employees wiped out 225,000 jobs. The reason why Craigslist has so few employees is that people place the ads themselves. That is called <strong>creative destruction</strong>. However the internet also created a lot of jobs. Other internet corporations like Yahoo, Google, Time Warner, Disney and Amazon hired tens of thousands of employees.</p>
<p>Suppose now that the country is controlled by a few and that the newspaper industry has a lot of influence on the government. And so it might happen that the government bans advertising on the web because this saves many jobs in the newspaper industry and because the government is captured by the newspaper industry. This might be a good thing because it saves jobs but this might also be a bad thing because it lowers productivity.</p>
<p>This model may also be applied in other fields such as our personal production and income. We can work hard, but if we don’t invest in new skills and technologies, our income may level out, or even go down when our skills become obsolete. Successful people continue to learn so that they improve their personal variable <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>The straw that broke the Camel’s back is utterly ridiculous example. Here is perhaps a few better ones:</p>
</div>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li>As the human body gains in muscle and loses fat it reaches a point where it can no longer float in water, at this point a swimmer must forever be treading water or swimming to keep afloat. The tipping point can also be viewed as drop survivability time for people in the sea.</li>
<li>The volume of an explosive reaches a tipping point when it is detonated.</li>
<li>Today most bridges can withstand cross winds. However in the past some bridge were not and cross wind during a storm could force a bridge to shake at its resonant frequency which caused it to break apart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also here are some worse examples of tipping point</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The drop in crime rate in New York is claimed by Malcom Gladwell to be an example of a tipping point. He suggested that “Broken Windows Theory” was what tipped crime rates in 1984 which was a policy of increasing the police force and getting them to crack down hard on misdemeanors like graffiti, jay-walking and free riding in the subway. Did this pretext of harassing minorities really motivated criminals to abandon crime, stop selling drugs, or emigrate to other cities with smaller police forces ?</li>
</ol>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="donohue2001impact">Donohue III and Levitt (2001)</span> a more convicting hypothesis for the decline of crime is presented. The economists also looked at other cities in the US that experienced similar dramatic drops in crime. What they report is that drops in crime rate took place in both rich cities that boosted trier police force and in poor cities that could not afford to. The point out that crimes follow a Pareto-distribution were 95% of all violent crime in big cities is due to a very small population of career criminals. They suggest that the drop was due to Roe Vs Wade passing about 18 years with the outcome that teen-agers and single mothers were able to avoid having children they could not support. The data required lots of massaging (murders are solved long after they are reported, there was a crack epidemic, some place had easier access to abortion etc,) And while this effect seems to occur globally in different localities after an 18 year lag this analysis has been challenged by others researchers several times. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#cite_note-7">Legalized abortion and crime effect</a></p>
<p>A third hypothesis is that the crime levels are correlated with the use of leaded gasoline. Lead is highly toxic to the human brain.</p>
<p>Often when people think about tipping points, they think of kinks in curves. Sometimes a kink in a curve reflects a tipping point, but not always. In many cases these kinks are just exponential growth, because with exponential growth you have a curve that takes off at some point. A book about tipping points <span class="citation" data-cites="gladwell2006tipping">(Gladwell 2006)</span>, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to see what is a tip and what is not, and also what kind of models produce tips. Two famous models are the percolation model from physics and SIS model from epidemiology. Percolation refers to the question whether or not water can make its way through a certain layer, e.g.&nbsp;the ground or a coffee filter. <strong>SIS</strong> stands for susceptible, infected and susceptible again, which is a simple model for diseases.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between types of tips. There are direct tips and contextual tips. With a direct tip or active tip, a variable itself changes, which causes it to tip. e.g., a battle might tip a war. With a contextual tip something changes in the environment that makes it possible for the system to move from one state to another. e.g., the density of the trees could tip the spread of a forest fire.</p>
<p>A system can be stable (in equilibrium), periodic, random or complex. A system can tip from one state to another but there are also tips within classes. e.g., a system might tip from one equilibrium to another equilibrium.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation">Percolation</a> models come from physics. The idea is that water comes down in the form of rain and the question is does the water percolate through the soil or not? To make a model, you can simplify the situation by using a checkerboard. The idea is that water can only percolate from one filled box to another, including diagonal directions. In the example, the water can’t make it to the bottom.</p>

</div></div><p>The model is as follows. Assume that the graph is big. Let <em>p</em> be the probability that a box gets filled. Then we ask the question: does it percolate? As long as <em>p</em> is less than 59.2%, it doesn’t percolate. Above this value, the system tips, and then it suddenly becomes likely that it does percolate.</p>
<p>What is causing the tip? For <em>p</em> less than 59.2%, there just aren’t enough boxes filled in. However, when the values passes 59.2%, it suddenly becomes more likely that the water percolates to the bottom.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>This model can be applied to all kinds of things, for instance forest fires. In this case, you can use the checkerboard to represent trees, and the filled in boxes represent the density of the forest. e.g., you set the forest density to 57% and set fire to all trees on the left side in the model.</p>
<p>As you can see, the fire doesn’t make it to the other side, even after repeated attempts. If you push up forest density to 61%, nearly all attempts will show that the forest fire makes it to the other side. This is an example of the fertility of models. A model that was used to explain percolation, can also be used for forest fires.</p>

</div></div><p>Curiously, the 59.2% threshold is also a tipping point in the yield curve of a forest. If you plant more trees, the yield of the forest in terms of wood produced rises in a linear fashion, until the tipping point, after which the yield will fall.</p>
<p>You can also apply this to banks. You can have a checkerboard of banks. If one bank fails then all banks that have loaned a lot of money to this bank may also fail. In this way bank failures can cascade.</p>

</div></div><p>The IMF has constructed models of banks that are more sophisticated. This model uses sophisticated accounting equations where banks have assets, capital, liabilities, and loans that are failing. You can then stress the system by having banks fail and see how far the failures spread.</p>
<p>This model is also based on the idea of percolation. In this model you can also ask the question whether there is a tipping point, where suddenly there are many bank failures? You could do the same with country failures.</p>

</div></div><p>You can also apply this on information percolating. Information spreads through networks of people. Assume that there is a probability that people will tell a piece of information to their friends, then you could ask what’s the likelihood that the information percolates as a function of this probability. The model would tell that if the piece of information, e.g.&nbsp;a gossip, is juicy enough, then it’s likely to spread.</p>
<p>Intuitively, you might think that there might be a linear relationship between the value of information and the number of people hearing of it, but if you use a network model with a probability of people telling the information across links, then nothing happens if the information is not very valuable, but once the value gets above some critical threshold, you might see a tipping point, and almost everybody will hear about it.</p>

<figcaption>From A to B</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This can also be applied to innovations. e.g., people may have been working on some technology for years or decades, and then suddenly a lot of people figure it out at approximately the same time. e.g., for a long time nobody made a steam engine, and suddenly many people were building steam engines. We see often bursts of scientific activity in a particular area, e.g.&nbsp;biotechnology where many people work on the same innovation at the same time.</p>
<p>Why does the percolation model apply here? Often finding a solution for a particular type of problem, e.g.&nbsp;producing a car or getting a mathematical proof, requires getting from A to B. There are many parts that have to work together, and you need a significant number of partial solutions to get through the whole problem. For instance, for a car you need wheels, brakes, an engine and a steering wheel.</p>
<p>As information accumulates, we can fill in more squares, and eventually someone can find a path from A to B. Suddenly there are multiple paths so that others can find other paths from A to B. It is therefore plausible that the percolation model explains those bursts in scientific activity.</p>

<figcaption>Diffusion graph</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>In a diffusion model everybody receives something, which could be information or a disease. The diffusion model works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose that there is some new disease called Wobblies,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W_t"> - is the number of people who got the Wobblies at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> is the total population.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%20-%20W_t"> is therfore the number of healthy.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CF%84"> - is the transmission rate or the likelihood that someone sick infects someone healthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if two people meet, then what is the likelihood that one person gives it to the other? <span id="eq-percolation-transmission-probability"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctau%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7BW_t%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B(N-W_t%20)%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Cqquad%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>You need one person who has the Wobblies and one person that doesn’t have it. So the probability is</p>
<p>You can also apply this to a new technology being adopted or a piece of information being spread, but in those cases people don’t have to meet physically.</p>
<p>The spreading also depends on the contact rate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">, which is how often people meet, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cN"> is the number of meetings. Hence,</p>
<p><span id="eq-percolation-progression"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AW_%7Bt+1%7D%20=%20W_t%20+%20c%5Ctimes%20N%20%5Ctimes%20%CF%84%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7BW_t%7D%7BN%7D%5Cfrac%7B(N-W_t%20)%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Cqquad%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p>The formula says that the spread will start slow because only a few people are affected, then speed up where more people are affected, and then, when most people are affected, slows down again because there are fewer people that can be affected. The model has no tipping point.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIS_model">SIS model</a> is much like the diffusion model but there is a difference. After people have been infected, they can recover and move back to the susceptible state. Hence,</p>

<p>The basic idea of a dynamical system is in the graph to the left. What does the graph say? If says that <em>x</em> is going to change over time. If <em>y</em> is positive, then <em>x</em> is going to change in the direction of the arrows on the left. However, if <em>y</em> is negative, then <em>x</em> is going to change in the direction of the arrows on the right. This system moves to a stable equilibrium where <em>x = y/2</em>.</p>

</div></div><p>More complicated graphs are possible. In the next graph, if <em>x &lt; 0.2</em> then it will move to 0, and if <em>x &gt; 0.2</em> then it will move to 0.5. In this case there are two stable equilibria, while and 0.2 is an unstable equilibrium or a tipping point. This is called a direct tip, where a slight change in a variable will cause the variable to move into another direction.</p>

</div></div><p>With a direct tip, a small change in the variable itself, can have a large effect on its end state. e.g., the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand tipped the whole system so that Europe went to war. Often directs tips were destined to happen, because the environment has become supportive of such an event.</p>
<p>If more and more preconditions are met, then the percolation model suggests that it is going to happen anyway. e.g., in the eve of World War I, the European powers were already forming alliances and preparing for war. So, often what causes a direct tip, is a change in the context. This is a contextual tip.</p>

</div></div><p>You can also apply this to the second graph. If you move down the line a little bit, then the system tips, and <em>x</em> will always move to 0. A contextual tip means that a small change in the environment has a large effect on the end state, often because of the number of squares filled in in the percolation model has reached the tipping point.</p>

<p>A system can be stable (in equilibrium), periodic, random or complex. A system can tip from one class to another but there are also tips within classes. e.g., a system might tip from one equilibrium to another equilibrium. This can be represented in a graph that depicts the movement of a variable <em>x</em> depending on some other variable <em>r</em>.</p>

<section id="sec-measuring-tips" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-measuring-tips">Measuring tips</h2>
<p>When measuring tips, we try to find out whether how likely the tip was going to happen. With an active or direct tip, the variable itself can cause the system to tip. If the system is at a tipping point, it is uncertain how it will behave. Once a tip has occurred, we know for certain how the system is going to behave. One way of measuring tippiness is by <em>reductions in uncertainty</em>.</p>
<p>A measure of uncertainty can be changes in the likelihood of different outcomes that could occur. Initially, there may be a large number of possible outcomes. After the system tips, there might be an equilibrium or one possible outcome, or a number of other things could occur. We measure changes in the likelihood of different outcomes using the diversity index, which is used in social sciences, and entropy, which comes from physics and information theory.</p>
<p>The <strong>diversity index</strong> for <em>i</em> possible outcomes is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csum%20P_i%5E%C2%B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>e.g., if we have three possible outcomes A, B and C, with probabilities</p>
<p><em>P(A) = 1/2</em>, <em>P(B) = 1/3</em> and <em>P(C) = 1/6</em>,</p>
<p>then the diversity index is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20/%20(1/4%20+%201/9%20+%201/36)%20=%2036/14%20%E2%89%88%202.57">.</p>
<p>For <em>i</em> possible outcomes, the maximum diversity is <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>e.g., if we have four possible outcomes A, B, C and D, which all have a probability of 1/4, so</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(A)%20=%201/4,%20P(B)%20=%201/4,%20P(C)%20=%201/4%20and%20P(D)%20=%201/4">, then the diversity index is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20/%20((1/4)%C2%B2%20+%20(1/4)%C2%B2%20+%20(1/4)%C2%B2%20+%20(1/4)%C2%B2)%20=%204."></p>
<p><strong>How can we use the diversity index to measure tips?</strong></p>
<p>If changes in a variable cause changes in the diversity index, this is indicative of a tip.</p>
<p>e.g., if initially there were three possible values, and the diversity index was 2.57, and then it flips to 1, the change in value of the diversity index is the measure of the tip.</p>
<p><strong>Entropy</strong> also measures the degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The formula for entropy is:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A-%5Csum_i%20P(X_i)%20log_2(P(X_i))%0A"></p>
<p><em>log2</em> is the inverse of the power of 2, so <em>log2(2x) = x</em>. e.g., log2(1/4) = log2(2-2) = -2. e.g., if we have four possible outcomes A, B, C and D, which all have a probability of 1/4, then the entropy is - ((1/4)<em>log2(1/4) + (1/4)</em>log2(1/4) + (1/4)<em>log2(1/4) + (1/4)</em>log2(1/4)) = 2.</p>
<p>Entropy tells us the number of bits of information we need to know to identify the outcome. If we have four possible outcomes A, B, C and D, which all have a probability of 1/4, you can split up the possiblities in half. It is either in A, B or in C, D. This is one bit of information. If it is in C, D then you need to know whether it is C or D. This is the second bit of information. You can always find the answer by asking two questions. Hence, the entropy is 2.</p>
<p>The diversity index shows the number of types. The entropy is the amount of information you need to identify the type. e.g., if you have options A and B that each have a probability of 1/2, then the diversity index is 2 and the entropy is 1. After the system tips, the diversity index goes to 1 and the entropy becomes 0, and you don’t need to ask any question to know what the state of the system is. Tips are changes in the likelihood of outcomes.</p>

<p>Categorical models allocates the data into different boxes. For example, trying to understand why some people live longer than others, we could divide them into people who exercise and people who do not exercise. By looking at the variation and the mean values in those boxes, you might find out whether or not this categorization says something about how long people live.</p>

<figcaption>Constructing linear model from data</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Linear models assume that some variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> depends on variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> is a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20f(X)">.</p>
<p>For instance, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> is life expectancy, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> might measure physical exercise. Thus, life expectancy is a function of how much a person exercises.</p>
<p>An important question is how we produce the linear model from the data. The line in the graph must represent the data as well as possible.</p>
<p>Nonlinear models could be represented by functions that do not produce a straight line, e.g., exponential growth functions. The diversity of nonlinear functions are enormous.</p>
<p><strong>The big coefficient</strong> refers to using the coefficient corresponding to the main effect size to make decisions. e.g., a function of school quality might be</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AY%20=%20a_1X_1%20+%20a_2X_2%0A"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1"> might be the class size and</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2"> might be teacher quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2"> are the coefficients. These coefficients tell how important the variable is, so the bigger the coefficient, the more important the variable.</p>
<p>Linear models can lead to big coefficient thinking, and if these are valid, then that will serve decision-makers better than rules of thumb, intuition, or experience. However, as time passes, reusing the main effect of an old model may be inadequate. There could be data drift, or alternatively, any improvement due to the main effect may have petered out due to diminishing returns. Over time, overhalling dysfunctional policies can require new and radical thinking. Approaches like revisiting old assumptions and rethinking out of the box can lead to something new, which we call new reality thinking. A problem with big coefficient thinking is that it only works in areas with specific data available. Over time, new data may even switch the size of the coefficients, leading to a loss of confidence in the model. Significant breakthroughs are often made by shifting to areas without data. A “new reality” will arise when the projections of big coefficients or even the assumptions behind them can be seen as inadequate, and decision-makers decide to rebuild a new model. ::: callout-warning ### Big Coefficient Warning:</p>
<p>Regression and Linear models can have negative coefficients, interaction terms and so on, which, with one negative term, can render the “big coefficient.” approximation or decision wrong. :::</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AY%20=%206%20X_1%20+%206%20X_2%20-%208%20X_3%20%5C%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bsubject%20to%7D%20(X_3%20=%20max(%7BX_1,X_2%7D))%0A"></p>
<p>We want to increase <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">. The big coefficient is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_3">, but it reduces <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">. Reducing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_3"> will reduce <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> since it also reduces <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1,%20X_2"> to increase. Increasing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">, we need to increase <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2"> together as increasing just one will increase <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_3"> and thus decrease <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">. The bottom line is that under certain conditions not listed by Dr.&nbsp;Page, the big coefficient is a useful approximation, but this assumption is not generally true in regression models. Dr.&nbsp;Page introduces the concept of a <strong>“new reality”</strong> to counter the shortcomings of big coefficient thinking. Unfortunately, the new reality that was introduced seems to have arisen from a failure. Later, he makes a case that “new reality” is a policy based on some other effect. However, these new reality initiatives seem to have no evidence to back them up. So this seems like <strong>muddy thinking</strong> rather than <strong>Clear thinking</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-categorical-models">Categorical models</h2>
<p>Categorical models allocate the data into different groups. Variation in and between groups can be capture much of the overall variation in variations in the data.</p>
<div id="exm-amazon-stock" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 1</strong></span> e.g., at the time of the IPO of Amazon, most analysts catagorised it as a delivery service like DHL or FedEx, and because the delivery buiness was such a cut-throat bussiness companies in it have low-profit margins so they thought Amazon would be a bad investment. A few analysts thought Amazon would be a good investment because they saw Amazon as part of the new information economy. Differnt analysts put Amazon in a different boxes. Amazon did badly for over a decade then they started letting computers a totatly differnt business model and then they did very well, so which box we choose matters for our investment portfollio and also which story you choose to tell. :::: {callout-info} ### dot.com crash &amp; the information economy. <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span> <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span> <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span></p>
<p>Any time I hear the concept of “the information economy” I am sad to recall how this “rethoric for a new economy” died with out when most of the dot.com companies burt through their VC/IPO money through incompetency or corrupt management caused a global recession. So I think Dr.&nbsp;Page is being disingenious by picking this example.</p>
<p>I also recall Amazon had zero or negative profits for over a decade after the doc.com crash. It overhauled its bussines concept servral times before it became a “good” investment and is facing stiff competition in its primery market from chinese stores. Also over times there are many new stories coming out how Amazon is making profits by squeezing it workforce to work harder and for less that DHL and FedEx which are both partners and competitors.</p>
<p>Finaly the question this example raises is: How can we find build a model that knows to place novel items accurately into new boxes without any other examples. Because model are supposed to better than analysts. In reality categorical model are not as resourceful as an analyst, they can’t invent new catergories. Event if is add some extra lables, without examples the model wont assign new items to these category.</p>
</div>
<p>::: Lump to live means that we create categories to make sense of the world. For example, if we see a car, we do not say there goes a 2003 Volkswagen 1.6 GTI, but we say car. We model to decide, plan, and design. One reason we lump is to make faster decisions. For example, a child may have a rule not to eat green items. This helps the child avoid eating grasshoppers, which it does not like to eat. However, the rule is not optimal. The child might forego a juicy pear in this way.</p>

<figcaption>Calories per food item</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>For example, you may have a list of calories per food item. We want to make sense of why some of these items have many calories and why others have not. The first thing we want to figure out is the average value . How much variation is there in the data? The mean is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(100%20+%20250%0A+90%20+%20110%20+%20350)%20/%205%20=%20180"> calories.</p>
<p>One way of determining the variation is the difference between every value and the mean. We take absolute values because these differences cancel each other out. Hence, the total difference from the mean is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?80%20+%2070%20+90%20+%2070%20+%20170%20=%20480."></p>

<p><img src="https://orenbochman.github.io/notes-model-thinking/posts/images/mt_squares.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Square differences</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>In statistics, the differences are squared to make every value positive and to amplify more significant deviations. e.g., for the pear we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(100%20-%20180)%5E2%20=%206,400">, and for the pie we get 28,900. It shows that substantial deviations from the mean greatly impact the total variation.</p>
<p>The obvious categorization is that pears, apples, and bananas are fruit, while cakes and pies are desserts. The fruit values are 90, 100, and 110, with a mean of 100 and a total variation of 200, while the dessert values are 250 and 350, with a mean of 300 and a total variation of 5,000.</p>
<p>Total variation went down from 53,200 to 5,200. Hence, the categories substantially reduce the amount of variation. Variation can be seen as unexplained, so the categorization explained a lot.</p>
<p>The total variation explained is</p>
<p><span id="eq-r-2-calcualtion"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(1%20-%205,200/53,200)*100%25%20=%2090.2%25%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>This is called the <strong>R-squared</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the R-squared is near 1, the model explains a lot of the variance in the data</li>
<li>if it is near 0, it explains very little of the variance in the data</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, there is so much variation in the data that great models only have an R-squared of 5% to 10%. Sometimes, the situation is clear-cut, and the R-squared is nearly 90%. There is no standard measure for the R-squared of a good model, but in a class of models, a higher R-squared means that the model is better.</p>
<p>Experts tend to have many useful boxes. The previous example of fruits and desserts could be enhanced with categories like vegetables and grains. If you want to be good at understanding how the world works, you need to have a lot of categories, which must also be helpful and explain much variation.</p>
<p>Even if the model explains a lot of variation, it does not mean that the model is good. If we want to figure out what determines good school performance, and we make a distinction between schools with an equestrian team and those without one, we might find out that schools with equestrian teams do better. However, that does not mean that the equestrian team made the school good. Correlation is not causation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-linear-models">Linear models</h2>
<p>Linear models assume that there is some independent variable <em>X</em> and a dependent variable <em>Y</em> that is a function of <em>X</em> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20mX%20+%20b">. This can be plotted in a graph. The value of <em>m</em> determines the slope. There are two questions: 1. sign of the coefficient: does <em>Y</em> increase or decrease with <em>X</em>? 2. magnitude of the coefficient: how much does <em>Y</em> increase for each unit increase in <em>X</em>?</p>
<p>Models are used to predict and to understand data. Assume we have a linear model for the price of a television: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cost%20=%20%5C$15%20%5Ctimes%20length%20+%20%5C$100">. So suppose we want to buy a 30-inch TV, then we can predict that it will cost $550. In this fashion, we can also try to predict the prices of counterfactual products, like a 100-inch TV.</p>

</div></div><p>One way to understand data is to make a line that fits the data. In this way, you can make a linear model that makes sense of the data and makes predictions. Even simple linear models are better than people. Professor Robyn Dawes wrote a paper comparing very primitive linear models.</p>
<p>One of his examples was 43 bank loan officers predicting which 30 of 60 companies would go bankrupt based on their financial statements. The bankers were 75% accurate, but a simple linear model based on the ratio between assets and liabilities was 80% accurate. In similar studies, experts did not do better than simple linear models.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-fitting-lines-to-data">Fitting lines to data</h2>
<p>An important question is how much variation can be explained using the model. If we take just the mean and calculate the variation, then there would be much variation. If we draw the right line, it is possible to explain 87.2% of the variation. The question is how to draw the best line.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>Let us do a simple example. Suppose we have three kids, and we want to figure out how much their grade explains their shoe size. We can see shoe size as a function of grade. The values for grade and shoe size for the three kids are (1,1), (2,5) and (4,9). The total variation from the mean 5 is: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(5-1)%5E2%20+%200%20+%20(1-5)%5E2%20=%2032">.</p>
<p>The goal is to make a linear model that explains as much of the variation as possible. Try $Y = 2X <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?.%20The%20variation%20would%20be">(1-2)^2 + (4-5)^3 + (9-8)^2 = 3$. In this way, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1%20-%203/32)%20=%2029/32"> of the variation would be explained, which is over 90%. Nevertheless, this is just a guess.</p>

<figcaption>Linear model</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>So, how do we fit the best line?</p>
<p>Assume the line to be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20mX%20+%20b">. Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> is called the intercept, which is the value for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20=%200">. How big is the total variation? How far would that line be from the data? That is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(m%20+%20b%20-%201)%5E2%20+%20(2m%20+%20b%20-%205)%5E2%20+%20(4m%20+%20b%20-%209)%5E2%20=%2021m%5E2%20+%2014mb%20+%203b%5E2%20-%2094m%20-%2030b%20+%2081">. It is now possible to find the values for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> to make the total variation the smallest.</p>
<p>These values are: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%20=%20-1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20=%208/3"> so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20-1%20+%20(8/3)m">. In this case, the total variation would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(2/3)%5E2%20+%20(2/3)%5E2%20+%20(2/3)%5E2%20=%20(4/9)%5Ctimes3%20=%204/3">. This would explain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1%20-%20(4/3)/32)"> of the variation, which is over 95%. The line is now even closer to the data.</p>
<p>Suppose there are multiple variables. e.g., the test score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> of kids might depend on their IQ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q">, teacher quality <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> and class size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> in the following way: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20a%20+%20bQ%20+%20cT%20+%20dZ">. We expect the coefficient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> on class size to be negative and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> as well as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> to be positive.</p>
<p>Of the 78 studies on class size, 4 showed a positive coefficient, 13 had a negative coefficient, and 61 showed no effect. Even though we think that class size matters, it appears not to matter much, at least within the range that has been studied. Research has shown that teacher quality matters far more.</p>
<p>We can fit data in linear models. These models can often explain some percentage of the variation. The models also show us the sign and the magnitude of the coefficients. This shows whether the variable has a positive or a negative effect and how big that effect is, allowing us to make policy choices.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-reading-regression-output">Reading regression output</h2>
<p>Somebody may give we some regression output, and we may have to make sense of this. When we see regression output, then we deal with a linear model based on multiple variables and functions like</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AY%20=%20m_1X_1%20+%20m_2X_2%20+%20%5Cldots%20+%20m_nX_n%20+%20b.%0A"></p>
<p>With multiple regression output, there is more than one <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> variable.</p>
<p>e.g., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> could be a test score depending on teacher quality <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> and class size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> so that the model function could be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20cT%20+%20dZ%20+%20b">. We could expect that better teachers lead to better results so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20%3E%200"> and bigger classes lead to poorer results so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20%3C%200">.</p>
<p>In the regression output, the standard error is 24.21, which tells us, on average, how much the values differ from the mean. The value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2%20=%200.72">, i.e., 72% of the variation, is explained by the linear model. There were 50 data points. The coefficient column tells us that the model is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%2020X_1%20+%2010X_2%20+%2025">.</p>
<p>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1"> is teacher quality and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2"> is class size, then the positive value for the class size coefficient raises some questions. Maybe the data is wrong, or maybe our intuition is wrong. So, we have to dig a little deeper. The first issue is that we have only 50 observations, so the coefficient may not be correct. The standard error (SE) column gives the error in the coefficients.</p>
<p>For the intercept, the coefficient is 25, and the standard error is 2, so 68% of the values are expected to be between 23 and 27. Hence, we could be really sure that the coefficient is between 19 and 31. Similarly, we could be really sure that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1"> is between 17 and 23, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2"> is between -2 and 22. The p-value gives the probability that the sign of the coefficient is wrong. We should not be so sure about the positive impact of class size on school performance.</p>
<p>The important issues to deal with are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How good is the model? How much of the variation does it explain?</li>
<li>sign of the coefficient: does <em>Y</em> increase or decrease with <em>X</em>?</li>
<li>magnitude of the coefficient: how much does <em>Y</em> increase for each unit increase in <em>X</em>?</li>
<li>what is the probability that the coefficient is wrong?</li>

<p>If we have some model like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AY%20=%20m_1X_1%20+%20m_2X_2%20+%20b%0A"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> might be sales,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1"> might be web advertising, and</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2"> might be print advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the coefficient is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m_1%20%3E%20m_2">, then we should advertise on the web rather than print. The coefficient is an evidence-based rank, and it is applied, for instance, in medicine, philanthropy, education, and management. Linear models based on evidence are better than guessing.</p>
<p>Evidence-based thinking with models works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>construct a model;</li>
<li>gather data;</li>
<li>identify important variables;</li>
<li>change those variables;</li>
</ol>
<p>Data science has seen a movement from the statistics era, in which data acquisition was expensive. However, the analysis was cheap, to an age where data is cheap, but the analysis is expensive. This has been called a movement towards big data. The <strong>big data approach</strong> is that we can begin with lots of data and fit the model later. Instead, we could do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>gather data;</li>
<li>find patterns;</li>
<li>identify important variables;</li>
<li>change those variables.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Big data does not make models obsolete</strong>. Models help to understand how the world works. Identifying the patterns is not the same as understanding where they came from, because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Correlation is not causation.</li>
<li>Linear models tell the sign and magnitude of changes in dependent variables within the data range. However, we need some understanding to tell whether the model will hold outside the data range.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am afraid I have to disagree with this mischaracterization of big data.</p>
<p>Who are these people who can analyze big data without a model?</p>
<p>Also, almost all the models in his book and in the course are not constructed using Causal methods, which is how we can discriminate correlation from causation and model them appropriately.</p>
<p>Regression and other methods shown here are not except for this problem. If the effects are linear, a linear model should extrapolate. If the effects are nonlinear, then who can say it, and why use a linear approximation? Also, I only know mathematical methods for extrapolating how a model (linear or not) will behave outside the observed range. Probabilistically, by looking at higher moments of a distribution analytically by considering more terms in a <em>Taylor approximation</em>. Statistically, cross-validation and Structural modeling are used to determine the impact of various causes on each effect. Finally, if we have more data, lots of patterns we initially see can be due to random chance, and we may be able to capture much more subtle effects happening in the real world.</p>

<p>One crucial issue is feedback. e.g., We may think that anti-lock brakes will reduce the number of accidents. That may be true initially, but after a while, people may start to drive closer to the car in front of them, so the benefits of anti-lock brakes might fall off.</p>

<p>So the good old boys who tech Price theory at Chicago have many examples like this about the unintended consequence of some dentist’s intervention by adding flouride to the water makes people brush thier teeth less and having even more cavaties…. But they make a good case in explain this by saying the dentist missed the point – people’s prefernces wen’r to have perfect teeth, so they were happier to not have to brush thier teeth as much. That is a more honest explanation. Now milton friedman went on TV and discussed things like seatbelt in cars, better tires and explained that if the market wants safer cars people will pay for them and that regulation is usally the least economically efficent way to go about it.</p>
<p>In the final anaysis if people paid for anti-lock brakes then these reduuced some accidents but not all accidents are caused by brakes locking and a car skidding. Head on collisions are a differnt story, burst tiers, falling asleep and many other reasons. I’m pretty sure that getting used to thier fancy brakes didn’t go to thier heads.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Page gave many trivial models, but this one is brought with purely hand waving.</p>
<p>A feedback mechanism can be positive or negative, but it is a nonlinear differential or difference equation.</p>
<p>The example is ridiculous - a person is taught how to drive, what distance to keep, etc. For a person to adjust to the new minimal distance of better brakes, they would have to have crashed the car non-fatally, at different speeds before and after the new brakes are introduced, and then make an adjustment based on that feedback - this cannot be an example of feedback.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>A bigger problem is <strong>multiple peaks</strong>. For example, we might have some data in a small range that suggests a peak. Thus, based on this data, the peak seems to be the optimal point, and you miss a better point.</p>

<p>While this is true,</p>
<p>This, again, is a nonlinear phenomenon. The presence of a single peak indicate the effect is not linear - linear means approximating a straight lines and lines do not have peaks.</p>
<p>I am unsure if any local method can tell you if you are in a local or global maximum. What is certain is that the better you fit a single peak, the worse you are at fitting the other peak.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>The new reality</strong> means that we may want to try something big and new, so we consider non-marginal changes. If we have only data in a small range, this may not help we very much. The multiple peak problem is just one instance of this issue.</p>
<p>Sometimes, big co-efficient thinking may be helpful, like taxing cigarettes to reduce healthcare costs and raise money to finance healthcare. A new reality might be implementing universal healthcare in the US. <sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;it might be but I prefer to view Universal healthcare and taxing cigatettes say to reduce lung cancer as two differnt issues and htus both likely to be perhaps run in parallel as happened during Barak Obama’s presidency and leter reversed by Donald Trump</p></div></div><p>The American Jobs Act is also an example of big coefficient thinking. A new reality was the US interstate highway system. In 1956, the US government allocated $25 billion, which is about $410 billion at today’s prices, for 41,000 miles of roads. This was creating something completely new, so it was difficult to calculate the employment effects. Big coefficient thinking can be good for minor changes but ignores new realities.</p>
<div class="{callout-note}">
<p>Sad to say that: The American Jobs Act is not an example of big coefficient thinking. There are just so many difernt tax cuts and clauses to make us think this is all based out of a big coeffinct in somebody’s regression model <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span> The construction of public works like roads is nothing new - following the great depression the government intiated a massive number of public works project. <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span> It pretty simple for the bean counters in the treasury deprtment to calculate how many jobs building 41,000 miles of road would create. <span class="emoji" data-emoji="poop">💩</span> Both are independent efforts tp solve differnt problems.</p>

<p>People are diverse, tending to pursue their own best interests. The following frameworks embody different approaches to model human behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rational actor model</strong>: This approach is based on rational choice theory, drawing from game theory and Adams Smith’s view of economics and treating people as homogenous goal optimizers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behavioral Economics</strong>: This approach is a pushback against the rational actor, using psychology to introduce diversity and limit rationality, thus offering a remedy to the rational actor model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule-based</strong>: This approach simplifies the above ideas by assuming people follow the rules without deeper motives. It is advantageous to agent-based modeling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a methodological approach to understanding social structures through networks and graph theory. It analyzes the relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information/knowledge entities.</p>
<p>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is a psychological theory that prioritizes human needs into a hierarchy, suggesting that people are motivated to fulfill basic needs before moving on to other, more advanced needs.</p>
<p><strong>Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)</strong>: This model categorizes human personality into five broad dimensions: openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. It’s widely used in psychology to understand and predict human behavior and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Social Role Theory</strong> suggests that individuals’ behavior is shaped by the roles they are expected to play in society, which are shaped by societal norms and structures.</p>
<p><strong>Symbolic Interactionism</strong> focuses on the meanings that people derive from social interactions and how these meanings shape individual behaviors and societal norms.</p>
<p>Today, we focus on the first three, but many models can mix and match different aspects of each approach. Also, many other ways exist to model people who do not fall under the above approaches.</p>

<section id="sec-rational-actor-model" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-rational-actor-model">Rational Actor model</h2>
<p>This approach builds on the definition of making rational decisions. Embodies the assumptions of choice and game theory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Agents have an objective - their goal in the model.</li>
<li>Given the objective, agents try to optimize their outcomes.</li>
<li>Agents are rational actors.</li>
<li>They are endowed with a utility function, giving them the capacity to numerically quantify and rank risks or benefits. They can impeccably rank any situation, decision, or collection of alternatives without errors or mistakes.</li>
<li>Certain bounds may be placed on their rationality like:
<ol type="1">
<li>Incomplete information on payoffs or the game structure, strategy of other players</li>
<li>Uncertainty</li>
<li>Self-control bound leading to a capacity for errors (brinksmanship and the shaking hand)</li>
<li>Iterated games that allow agents to adapt and learn.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>They will develop a strategy profile, which is a collection of optimal action at each juncture in a finite tree of uncertain eventualities arising from the actions of other agents. The weighted sum of utilities or profits are called payoffs at the leaf nodes of such a tree, the possible scores that rational actors people can optimize, and they help to keep track of the games’ score</li>
</ol>
<p>It helps to distinguish between a Decision Model that depends on the agent’s actions and a Game that involves actions by other agents or the environment. It also helps to distinguish rationality from selfish behavior. Game theory first dealt with <strong>zero-sum</strong> games. These were non-cooperative scenarios like chess, which dealt in absolutes, imposing winner-takes-all rules. With the advent of Nash equilibrium, the field opened up to include a broader range of cooperative games with <strong>win-win</strong> scenarios that can model diverse team behaviors like <em>coordination</em>, <em>signaling</em>, <em>evolution of cooperation</em>, <em>altruism</em>, and <em>social dilemmas</em>. When there are additional players, the <em>Core</em> and <em>Shapley values</em> provide a rational way for players to form coalitions and even conspiracies in which they pool resources and allocate shared payoffs fairly.</p>
<p>Agents know or learn to apply different <strong>solution concepts</strong> like <em>Minimax</em>, <em>Backwards Induction</em>, <em>Forward Induction</em>, <em>Nash Equilibrium</em>, and <em>Bayesian Equilibrium</em>, which are formal rules that determine how a game will unfold and based on the rules, constraints, and incentives of another agent. Furthermore, rational agents may refine their solutions to eliminate pathological cases.</p>

<p>We can represent games in Normal form and Extensive form.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive-form_game">Extensive form of a game</a> describes how a game unfolds in terms of action and response arranged using a tree.
<ol type="1">
<li>uncertainty can then be represented by assigning a probability tree with nodes for each player’s actions and the payoffs at the leaves.</li>
<li>bound on the availability of information can be indicated using information sets. This also allows extensive form games to model simultaneous moves using a tree - by letting players move in turn but in ignorance of the other player’s moves.</li>
<li>incomplete information—such as information about other players’ payoffs or the type of their opponents, adds an initial move by “nature,” setting these at random at the start but in a privileged information set.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Normal form summarizes the opposing payoffs using a contingency table for all possible action combinations. However this is the form in which it is possible to work our different equilibrium solutions.</li>

<p>Behavioral models are critical of the rational actor assumption based on evidence of actual behavior, neuroscience, and psychology. Experiments reveal systematic deviations from optimal choices, and neuroscience sheds light on how our brain structure, information processing, and thinking patterns lead us astray from rational actor predictions.</p>
<p>In Thinking, Fast and Slow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="kahneman2011thinking">Kahneman (2011)</span> proposes two systems of thought: fast processes driven by emotion and quick cues and slow processes that are more deliberate and rational. Fast thinking makes us susceptible to biases that the rational actor model ignores.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein">Cass Sunstein</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler">Richard Thaler</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="thaler2012nudge">(Thaler and Sunstein 2012)</span> argue that these systematic errors in human judgment have significant implications for policy design.</p>
<p>Four types of well-documented biases cause behavior to deviate from rational behavior:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prospect theory</strong> is an agent’s bias to be risk averse for profits yet risk loving for losses.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperbolic discounting</strong> is a view by agents that recent rewards are preferable to equivalent future rewards</li>
<li><strong>Status quo bias</strong> is a preference to avoid change</li>
<li><strong>Base rate bias</strong> means our current thinking influences us.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prospect theory</strong> explains seemingly irrational gambling behavior. For example, people might choose a guaranteed $400 over a 50% chance of winning $1,000 but prefer a 50% chance of losing $1,000 over a guaranteed $400 loss.</p>
<p>Kahneman came up with the following example.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two options. You can get $400 for sure, or you get a 50% chance of winning $1,000 and a 50% chance of gaining $0. A lot of people would choose the $400 for sure. If the amounts get larger, people become more risk-averse in gains. However, when there is a choice between an inevitable loss of $400 or a loss of $1,000 at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(loss)%20=%200.5"> or a loss of $0, people are more willing to take the gamble. Both behaviors are not rational.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperbolic discounting</strong> explains our preference for immediate gratification. We might choose $1,000 today over $1,005 tomorrow but prefer $1,005 in a year and a day over $1,000 in a year. This leads to the “chocolate cake” dilemma – we might plan to resist temptation in the future but succumb when faced with immediate gratification.</p>
<p>e.g., we tend to prefer $1000 now to $1005 tomorrow, but we tend to prefer $1005 over a year and a day to $1000 over a year. Immediate gratification matters a lot to humans. This often has what is called the chocolate cake implication. People want to be healthy, so if you are offered a chocolate cake a week from now, you are more likely to decline the offer, but if the chocolate cake is put in front of you, you are more likely to eat it. This is because fast thinking prevails.</p>

<figcaption>Check box to contribute</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>The <strong>status quo bias</strong> explains our resistance to change. For example, people are less likely to contribute to a pension fund if they have to actively opt in, compared to having to opt out.</p>
<p>e.g., if people have to check a box to contribute to the pension fund, most of them won’t check the box, but if they have to check a box to not contribute to the pension fund, most of them still won’t check the box. This is because checking the box implies a change. In England, people have to check a box to donate organs, and 25% of people do so. In the rest of Europe, people have to check a box not to donate organs, and only 10% have.</p>
<p>The <strong>base rate bias</strong> demonstrates how our current thoughts influence our judgments. For example, if asked to estimate the manufacturing date and price of a box, the answers are often close together, as the initial number influences the subsequent estimate.</p>
<p>For example, when people are asked when a box is made and how much it costs, the answers are often close to each other. e.g., you may think that the box may is made in 1950 (50), and then you probably estimate price close to that number, for instance 52. This is because you were already thinking of a number, so if you have to think of another number, this number probably is close to the first number.</p>
<p>There are many more biases, and they are well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">documented</a>. There are also criticisms. For instance, most of those biases are found in <em>Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Developed</em> (<em>WEIRD</em>) countries. So, how many of them apply to other countries as well? Furthermore, people learn so that they may overcome their biases. Finally, it can be computationally difficult to account for all kinds of biases, so many models assume people are rational. One way to deal with this is to use simple rules. A more sophisticated way is to start assuming that people are rational, and then look for the biases that are relevant, and include them in the model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-rule-based-models">Rule based models</h2>
<p>Rule-based models assume people simply follow predetermined rules. For example, the Schelling model posits that individuals will relocate if the percentage of similar people in their vicinity falls below a threshold.</p>
<p>For example, the Schelling model presumes that people will move as soon as the percentage of similar people falls below a certain threshold. There are four types of rules-based behaviors in two dimensions. There are fixed and adaptive rules in a decision context or a game context where the payoff depends on what other people do. In a <em>game</em> context, a rule is often called a <strong>strategy</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fixed decision rules</strong>: Examples include random choice (used as a benchmark) and taking the most direct route, which may not be optimal.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a fixed decision rule is <strong>random choice</strong>. Random choice, like optimal choice, can be used as a benchmark. You can compare optimal choice and random choice and see how the model behaves under those assumptions to get more understanding about what might happen and what could happen. Another example of a fixed rule is taking the most direct route, which is the route closest to the right direction. This may not be the shortest or the fastest route, so this rule may not be optimal.</p>

</div></div><p><strong>Fixed strategies</strong>: Examples include <strong><em>dividing resources evenly</em></strong> and <strong><em>tit for tat</em></strong>, where cooperation is reciprocated and defection is punished. An example of a fixed strategy is <strong>divide evenly</strong>. For example, if heirs divide an asset, they might decide to divide it evenly. Another fixed strategy is tit for tat. e.g., person A starts out acting nice to person B, and he continues to act nice as long as person B acts nice, but if person B acts mean, person A will act mean too. But if person B starts acting nice again, person A will act nice too.</p>

<figcaption>Grim trigger Moore Machine</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Tit-for-tat and grim trigger are fixed strategies represented by Moore Machines. Tit for tat starts with cooperation and only switches to defection if the other player defects, returning to cooperation when the opponent cooperates again. <strong>Grim trigger</strong>, however, permanently switches to defection after a single defection by the opponent.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Adaptive decision rules</strong>. These rules are adjusted based on feedback. Examples include the <strong><em>gradient-based methods</em></strong>, where actions are continuously adjusted in the direction of improvement, and <strong><em>trial-and-error</em></strong> approaches.</p>
<p>e.g., suppose that you are baking cookies, and start adding one spoon full of honey, and it turns out that the cookies are very good. The next time, try adding two spoons full of honey. If the cookies taste even better, you might add another spoonful of honey. You might go on until the cookies start to taste too sweet. Another adaptive rule is random behavior or changing what you are doing until you find something better. With regard to cookies, add raisins, chocolate, or walnuts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptive strategies</strong>. These strategies are particularly relevant in games, where adapting to others’ behavior can be advantageous. Examples include <strong>best response</strong>, where an agent chooses the optimal action given the opponent’s action, and <strong><em>mimicry</em></strong>, where successful behaviors are imitated.</p></li>

<section id="sec-when-does-behavior-matter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-when-does-behavior-matter">When does behavior matter?</h2>
<p>The significance of accurately modeling behavior depends on the situation. Two contrasting examples are two-sided markets and races to the bottom. In a <strong>two-sided market</strong> with buyers and sellers, the market price tends to converge towards equilibrium regardless of whether agents are rational, partially informed, or even completely uninformed. Behavior has minimal impact on the outcome.</p>
<p>In a <strong>race to the bottom</strong> game, where the winner is the player closest to two-thirds of the average guess, rational players will converge on a guess of zero. However, introducing biases can significantly alter the outcome, with guesses clustering around 50, 33, and 22, reflecting a mix of bias and attempts at rational calculation. Repeated play can lead to convergence towards zero as players adapt their strategies.</p>
<p>These examples highlight that while rational behavior serves as a valuable benchmark, incorporating biases and considering simple rules are crucial for accurate modeling. Ultimately, the importance of behavior depends on how much it affects the model’s outcome. If the impact is minimal, precise behavioral modeling might be unnecessary. However, for situations where behavior significantly influences outcomes, selecting the most appropriate model type becomes critical.</p>

<p>Decision models encode how people make decisions as well as how they should make decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive models</strong> predict the behavior of others.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_model_of_decision-making"><strong>Normative models</strong></a> provide guidance on how to make better, more consistant decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Multi criteria</strong> <strong>models</strong> make decision using multiple input variables.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial models</strong> are multi-criteria decision-making models that assume that there are a two dimensions and an ideal point. They try to infer how far the query is from the ideal point for each feature.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-criteria models</strong>: These models allow for the consideration of multiple factors in the decision-making process.</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic models</strong>: These models incorporate uncertainty into the decision-making process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decision trees can be used to handle uncertainty with the added bonus that trees make it easy to evaluate the value of information they encode.</p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 9 (Buy or rent a car)</strong></span> Suppose we are thinking about buying a car. We are worried about buying today since we have heard there might be a cash-back program next month in which we could get $1,000 back. We figure there’s a 40% chance there will be a cash-back program.</p>
<p>We might could rent a car for $500 then wait if cash-back materialises.</p>
<p>Now suppose we know someone at the auto company who can sell us this information, how much would it be worth to pay him?</p>
<p>This is fairly easy to estimate with a decision tree.</p>
<p>The choice is between renting or buying a car.</p>
<p>We can see from the figure that - the value of renting without information is $0.4 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C$500%20+%200.6%20%5Ctimes%20-%5C$500%20=%20-%5C$100">. - the value of the buying, is $0. - buying is best without information.</p>

<p>Since before our best course had 0 USD expected payoff, this is also the value of the information.</p>

<p>The decision book list around 50 of different models for different decisions. Some scenarios include marketing, picking gifts. Some are well known others obscure. The text, however, is very compact which means that these models will require additional research if they seem useful. What I liked though is that every reviewer seems to have picked a different subset.</p>

<p>Whenever we hear a physicist make a big claim, but not about physics, I get skeptical and may even play the devil’s advocate <span class="emoji" data-emoji="imp">👿</span>. Physicists are trained to be astute observers, and many are sharp thinkers.</p>

<li>Why isn’t he doing Physics?</li>
<li>How does he even know that his methods can fit in the social science/etc paradigm?</li>
<li>Is he making outrageous claims?</li>
</ol>
<p>Recall two sad truths about physics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum theories frequently fail to aggregate to scales of human experience, AKA the classical limit.</li>
<li>There isn’t a Quantum theory of gravity that aggregates to relativistic scales<sup>1</sup>. And I never heard of other quantum theories that did.</li>
</ul>
<p>So physicists could stick to physics and determine how Aggregation works. That said, I must admit that Phillip W. Anderson knows what he is talking about—even if I don’t like how his point is presented.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;yet gravity is the oldest force physicists discovered.</p></div></div><p>Aggregation can capture the emergent properties of a system, which gets interesting when an emergent phenomenon diverges from the behaviors of its constituent parts. <mark>The key question is “How does more become different?”</mark></p>
<p>The most prominent model for Aggregation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">Central Limit Theorem</a> that arises from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a> with the requirements that we aggregate over many similar non-interacting units with bounded effects. This leads us to easy mean and variance estimates using the empirical rule.</p>
<p>Next, I would use more general statistical summary functions that we call <strong>population parameters</strong> if we can track the entire system or <strong>model statistics</strong> if we can only sample from the population. There may be different levels of aggregation possible for our model. Preferences and ordered relations can be challenging to aggregate in a way that maintains transitivity. However, it is relatively easy to aggregate demand patterns.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Stacking small changes with the Central Limit theorem.</li>
<li>Using a single to aggregate behavior in the game of life.</li>
<li>Using a family of rules: how to aggregate using one-dimensional cellular automata models</li>
<li>Preferences: how to aggregate preferences, e.g., to make collective choices.</li>
</ol>
<p>We model for the following reasons:</p>

<li>predict points</li>
<li>understand data, e.g., using a bell-shaped curve</li>
<li>understand patterns, e.g., the glider pattern in the game of life</li>

<p>A <strong>Probability Distribution</strong> lists a variable’s different outcomes, each with its likelihood of occurring.</p>
<p>The <strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong> states that if we add up a large enough series of independent variables, the distribution will follow a normal distribution characterized by a bell–shaped curve. The most likely outcome, the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BC">, is in the middle of the curve.</p>

<p>e.g., set the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> to 100, and the standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> to 3, then for 95% of all cases, the outcome will fall in [94, 106].</p>
<p>In a Binomial distribution where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20=%201/2"> like flipping coins, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20=%20(%5Csqrt%7BN%7D)/2">, thus when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%20=%20100">, the mean is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?100/2%20=%2050">, and the standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma=%E2%88%9A100/2%20=%205">.</p>
<p>In general, Binomial distributions have a standard deviation of success for N trials:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csigma%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B(p(1-p)N)%7D%0A"> {eq-binom-sd}</p>
<p>When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D"> then this simplifies to: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csigma%20=%20%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%7B2%7D%0A"> {eq-binom-sd-std}</p>
<p>We can now use this standard deviation to make statistical inferences. Airlines overbook to increase their profits, so they need to know the probability of someone not getting a seat. This allows them to estimate the expected cost of offering people a second ticket to take the next flight.</p>

Caution&nbsp;2: Six sigma In a nutshell

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Six Sigma</strong> is a project management methodology, not an aggregation method.</p>
<p>We will revisit it later when it is time to consider the tradeoffs between reducing variation as practiced in <strong>Six Sigma</strong> and increasing variation to speed up convergence in <strong>Replicator Dynamics</strong>.</p>

<p>When I asked friends who worked at Motorola, they said that one department used it to win prizes in the company. Still, it never really caught on to become the ubiquitous management technique its proponents have touted.</p>
<p>Even with extensive training, statistics can be challenging in most business scenarios. Recall that Ronald Fischer’s influential works were prescriptive how-to manuals that did little to impart their authors’ depth of knowledge. That said, even a little statistics can go a long way.</p>

In essense it aggregate activity stemming from a single rule at differnt location that can leads to surprisingly complex system.</p>
<p>In the system thinking paradigm, the worldview is that all parts of the system under study are interconnected. In this paradigm, inferring how macro-behavior emerges from micro-motives is one of the main challenges for researchers. Viewed through this system-thinking prism, the game of life is a microcosm whose emergent complexity is an analog of the challenges of aggregation in the real world. ,</p>

<p>The Figure 8 pattern is periodic, with a cycle length of 8 steps, generating a sequence of complex patterns. The F-Pimento pattern moves in space generating gliders.</p>
<p>We could say that even simple brain cells, following basic rules, can give rise to complexity of thinking, remembering, and understanding.</p>
<p>The Game of Life doesn’t spell out how our minds work, but it intimates that our thoughts may just be an aggregate of these simpler parts working together. A glider pattern is a cool example of this: it’s when a shape moves across the board, popping up again in a new spot after a few moves</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a> a Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist introduced Cellular automata. The game of life is a type of cellular automata. We focused on one-dimensional cellular automata to see that the notions of complex systems we have just explored can be seen even when we restrict these rule-based systems to a single dimension. The restriction reduces the number of neighbors available in the rules. These automata are more straightforward to enumerate and study in detail. Some of this work is collected in <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/">A New Kind of Science</a> by the author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>.</p>
<p>The cellular automata models we considered were one-dimensional, which made their rules simpler than the ones used in the game of life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cells have two neighbors, except those on the borders.</li>
<li>This lets us write out all possible rules</li>
<li>We can also track the model’s evolution along the vertical axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, think of it like a game where you have a cell that can be either on or off, and its fate is decided by its own current state along with the state of its neighbors on each side. Picture three cells in a row - together, they can end up in eight different combinations. Now, for each of these combinations, our middle cell has two choices: it can either light up (on) or stay dark (off).</p>

<figcaption>Rule 30 in Netlogo</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>This setup gives us 256 different ways (or rules) to determine what happens to our middle cell based on those three-cell setups. It’s kind of like flipping switches on or off depending on the pattern you see.</p>
<p>We can keep track of these rules by assigning them numbers, kind of like naming each unique switch-flipping strategy. For the cell to turn on or off when all three cells are off, we decide if this situation is a “1” (turn on) or a “0” (stay off), and we do this for all eight combinations. In one of the scenarios we’re talking about, the pattern is called “00001110” in binary code, which translates to 30.</p>
<p>The image shows what happens with this rule number 30 in action for the first few steps. We can simulate this rule using Netlogo, and it will show a complex pattern and behavior where the middle cell is tough to predict in advance.</p>

<ul>

<li>randomness</li>
<li>complexity</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>The question is why do rules go to a specific state? Or more specifically what creates chaos, what creates complexity and what creates order?</mark></p>
<p>The fact that such simple models lead to such complexity has led physicists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler">John Wheeler</a> to suggest in <span class="citation" data-cites="Wheeler1999InformationPQ">(Wheeler 1999)</span> that reality itself may arise out of binary processes.

</div></div>
<p>Langton’s Lambda <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> can tell what the outcomes look like. <mark>Langton asked a much simpler question: How many things go on?</mark> e.g., in rule 30, four cells out of eight switch on. Lambda is the percentage of cells that go on; in this case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%204/8%20=%201/2">. For rule 110, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%205/8">.</p>
<p>Based on the Lambdas values, we will see differnt behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%200"> then all cells die off;</li>
<li>if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%201/8"> then the system blinks;</li>
<li>if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%201"> then all cells switch on;</li>
<li>if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> is in [3/8, 5/8], most of the complex or random patterns will appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus intermediate levels of codependence tend to create complexity and randomness. Pattern trading is an idea of tracking such intermediate levels of interdependence in markets, which present to complex patterns.</p>

</div></div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox">Condorcet Paradox</a> of aggregation states that if you aggregate individual preferences, you might get irrational preference orderings, even when individual preferences are rational.</p>
<p>e.g.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%3E%20B%20%3E%20A%20%3E%20C">,</p>
<p>even when individual preferences are rational. This can happen when people have different preferences.</p>
<p>e.g., person 1 has preference</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%3E%20B%20%3E%20C">, person 2 has a preference</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20%3E%20C%20%3E%20A"> and person 3 has a preference ordering</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%3E%20A%20%3E%20B">.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such a situation, the aggregate preference ordering is not apparent. A possible solution is to order the preferences pairwise. Persons 2 and 3 prefer kiwi fruit to apples, so the aggregate preference is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%3E%20A">. Other aggregate preference are</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20%3E%20C"> and</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%3E%20B">. So we get</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%3E%20A%20%3E%20B%20%3E%20C"></li>
</ul>
<p>This may have consequences, when we want to aggregate votes. Even when individuals vote rationally, there is no guarantee that the collective outcome is rational. This surprising outcome introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="arrow1950figgiculty">(Arrow 1950)</span> by Economics Nobel Laureate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a> is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">Arrow Impossibility theorem</a> in Game theory and Economics of social welfare.</p>
<p>Since collective outcomes may not be rational, people may vote strategically, or there may be all kinds of political games where voters try to manipulate the outcome of an election into the desired result by misrepresenting their preferences.</p>

<p>Why do individuals who study, reside, or spend time together often exhibit similarities in appearance, thought processes, and behaviors?</p>
<p>Any number of mechanisms may lead to the creation of homogeneous groups. We will study primarily the first two of the following mechanisms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sorting effect</dt>
<dd>
<p>preferential exodus into neighborhoods with similar neighbors increases homogeneity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Peer effect</dt>
<dd>
<p>Social pressure from peers causes people to conform or to leave, increasing homogeneity.</p>

<dt>Bandwagon effect:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a follow-the-leader effect first noticed in politics. c.f. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect">bandwagon effect</a>** in the many context <em>innovation, marketing, economics</em> ,</p>

</div></div><dl>
<dt>Adverse Selection</dt>
<dd>
<p>When most sellers lack incentives to participate in a market, we end up with a homogenous market full of inferior products. This was investigated in the seminal paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Akerlof1970Lemons">(Akerlof 1970)</span> called the “Market for Lemons,” where the author discusses <strong>adverse selection</strong> in <em>economics</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you look at the map of Detroit, you see that people of different ethnicity tend to live together in segregated communities. Birds of a feather flock together, and people who look like each other tend to live together. Since people can not change their skin color, the mechanism for this is <strong>Sorting</strong>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, people could adapt their behavior to match that of others around them. e.g., kids who hang around with kids that are smoking may take an occasional cigarette, and start smoking in this way. Alternatively, if you hang out with people who are serious about their health and don’t smoke, then you might decide to quit smoking. These are examples of <strong>peer effects</strong>.</p>
<p>Both <em>sorting</em> and <em>peer effects</em> create uniformity within groups. Models have been developed to better understand these mechanisms. Their results have revealed some unexpected insights. In many cases where uniformity is observed, the mechanism that creates the effect isn’t clear. We can’t tell if we are dealing with sorting, peer effects, a combination, or something else. In other words, a model is not an alternative to research. The models we will consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Schelling’s segregation model</em> tries to explain how segregation is driven by sorting.</li>
<li><em>Granovettor’s Threshold model</em>, which is centered around how a minority’s willingness to participate in some collective behavior can define the behavior of the whole group.</li>
<li><em>The standing ovation model</em> explains how uniformity arises through a peer effect.</li>
<li>How we can distinguish between sorting and peer effects is called the <strong>identification problem</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal Model</strong> These are primarily mathematical and logical specifications. The idea behind formalism in mathematics is that most theories, when specified with great precision, lead to greater insights and elimination of paradoxical results. However, a formal model is usually the result of a deep analysis of informal models.</li>
<li><strong>Game theoretical Models</strong> are models involving agents that rationally, following a detailed strategy which maximizes their expected rewards. In this sense their actions can be called optimal. However many real world optimization problems defy an optimal solution.</li>
<li><strong>Agent based models</strong> use agents to represent individuals, organizations or even countries. The agents follow simple rules that govern their behavior and are implemented using framework like NetLogo or Mesa.</li>
</ul>
<p>ABMs are easy to code, particularly when we know an ABM framework. ABMs can be iteratively refined or simplified. ABMs can be made interactive - which facilitates quick exploratory analysis. ABMs are amenable to automated analysis. Which might reveal optimal strategies that let us proceed to a Game Theoretical model Alternatively, we might use them to formalize the model by deriving some equations that describe the emergent macroscopic behavior. The agents may also be given the capacity to learn more optimal behavior using RL (reinforcement learning). ABM may be tested for their capacity to match real-world phenomena. ABM models that are a good fit can also be calibrated to match the behavior in observed data more closely.</p>
<p>For example, there are many Formal Contagion models that use PDEs to model epidemics. While SIRX models can just as easily handle billions of patients as thousands. However, they cannot be readily queried to check the effectiveness of different mitigation methods for a disease. ABMs, Although limited to 100,000 agents, were used to explore mitigations in various scenarios like nursing homes, primary schools, secondary schools, and even prisons. They were also modified to match specific cases and calibrated using a few real test cases.</p>
<p>Thus, ABMs can give us a high value for our effort and fit into a rapid response.</p>

<p>In research papers <span class="citation" data-cites="schelling1969models">(Schelling 1969)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="schelling1971dynamic">(Schelling 1971)</span>, and later in <span class="citation" data-cites="schelling1978micromotives">(Schelling 1978)</span>, his famous yet erudite opus Nobel Laureate in Economist and noted game theorist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling">Thomas Schelling</a> outlines how he applied his unique brand of game theory to explore how ethnic and income-based segregation arises in a city. Schelling worked out his model by hand using a game board for a city and some pennies for his agents. He soon discovered that encoding homophily as an incentive for agents to relocate rapidly segregated his city.</p>
<p>Today we can simulate using Agent Based Modeling (ABM) packages like <a href="https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Segregation.nlogo">Netlogo</a> or <a href="w02_schelling_mesa.html">Mesa</a> to implement Schelling’s model. with different thresholds.</p>

<p>we can see that a slight preference of homogeneity leads to almost full segregation in this model. From watching the simulation, we can see that most cascades are concentrated at the boundary of segregated zones and that unhappiness will often be minimized by reducing the boundary to a single line from one edge of the city to another.</p>
<section id="insights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insights">Insights</h3>
<p>The insights of simulating Schelling’s model are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Segregation and other emergent macro-level effects may not reflect the behavior and preferences of individuals at the micro level. We see that individuals who are happy so long as they live with just a minimal proportion of their ethnic group within their vicinity will ultimately find themselves in a state of pronounced segregation.</li>
<li>Segregation actually breaks down if intolerance gets too high enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, we will return to the idea of tipping points. But lacking a clear definition makes the discussions rather pedestrian at times.</p>
<p>I like to think of a tipping point as a critical point in systems dynamics at which there is a discontinuity in macroscopic behavior. Phase changes are best understood in physical systems, where we often find that they have higher-dimensional geometry since the phase change depends on multiple factors.</p>
<p>What Scott calls “a tip” is more straightforward to understand if we call it “a cascade,” which I define as “a chain reaction or sequence of events arising from a single cause.” Not all models exhibit cascades, but when they do, they are a significant part of how the micro is transformed into the macro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the simulation I looked at in NetLogo and Mesa doesn’t show how to keep track of cascades and visualize them in real time. The <strong>tipping points</strong> in this model are the thresholds described above at which we will see large-scale segregation emerge, and the second one is where it stops, and we see permanent churn emerge. What are described below are cascades.</p>
<p>Schelling’s model has a cascade phenomenon. For example, if one person moves, this may trigger another person to move, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is an <strong>Exodus cascade</strong>, which means that a person will leave if a similar person in the neighborhood leaves. The trigger for this cascade for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is due to a like-me neighbor leaving and thus decrementing the numerator of the ‘threshold’ equation from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N/D">, which is still happy, to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(N-1)/D">, which is no longer happy, thus triggering <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">’s move. These exodus cascades will start with the most intolerant neighbor of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, but others with lower thresholds may follow dropping.</p></li>

</div></div><p>In this lesson, we set our sights on the <strong>Index of Dissimilarity</strong> as a measure of segregation between two demographic groups living in the same metropolitan region. Its advantage is it’s easy to calculate. Its main shortcoming is that it cannot handle multiple groups, nor can it deal with a continuous variable like wealth. In this section, we consider wealth a dichotomous variable: people are either rich or poor.</p>
<p>What I wanted from this section was to learn the logic for creating such statistics/metrics by myself. I guess that this is not so easy as it seems. However there are a number of other approaches for evaluating segregation and wealth in equality.</p>
<p>Metrics follows</p>
<p>The metric we developed for evaluating segregation called <strong>The index of dissimilarity</strong> was introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="duncan1955methodological">(Duncan and Duncan 1955)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s posit a scenario in which a mix of upper and lower class agent live in 24 residential tracts, each inhabited by 10 individuals. Within this configuration, 12 luxury tracts are priced exclusively for rich individuals, 6 tracts of public residential facilities cater only the poor while the remaining 6 tracts share a demographic mix of rich and poor in equal proportion.</p>
<p>The aggregate count of the upper class is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A12%5Ctimes%2010%20+%206%5Ctimes%205%20=%20150%0A"></p>
<p>Whereas the total number of the lower class amounts to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A6%5Ctimes%2010%20+%206%5Ctimes%205%20=%2090%0A"></p>
<p>Let</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> be the quantity of a particular group within a tract,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> be the aggregate quantity of that group (150),</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> be the quantity of the contrasting group within that tract,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> be the total number of the contrasting group (90),</li>
</ul>
<p>then the difference between the proportions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7BB%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7By%7D%7BY%7D">, or</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-segregation-in-multiple-categories-entropy-index">Segregation in Multiple Categories: Entropy Index</h3>
<p>Both the Index of Dissimilarity and Interaction Index can only measure the segregation of two groups compared to each other.</p>
<p>The <strong>Entropy Index</strong> is a measure of diversity that measures the spatial distribution of multiple groups simultaneously. It may be used to quantify segregation in a population across multiple groups. It is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-entropy-index"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7B%7BEntropy%20Index%7D%7D%20=%20-%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20p_%7Bij%7D%20%5Clog(p_%7Bij%7D)%20%5Cqquad%0A%5Ctag%7B6%7D"></span></p>
<p>In this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the total number of groups.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bij%7D=%20%5Cfrac%7Bn_%7Bij%7D%7D%7Bn_i%7D"> is the ratio of group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> in cell <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_%7Bij%7D"> = number of population of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"><sup>th</sup> ethnicity in cell <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_%7Bi%7D"> =total population in cell <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"></li>
<li>The sum is taken over all groups <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> in each cell <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</li>
<li>The logarithm is typically base 2 or base <code>e</code> (natural logarithm), depending on the context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation: - The Entropy Index ranges from 0 (no diversity, all members belong to the same group) to <code>log(n)</code> (maximum diversity, members are evenly distributed across all groups). - In the context of segregation, a lower Entropy Index indicates higher segregation (less diversity within areas), while a higher Entropy Index indicates lower segregation (more diversity within areas).</p>

<p>One more point to consider is, given all the simplifying assumptions, how useful is the scheduling model for modeling reality?</p>
<p>In real life, residential real estate is usually bought through careful deliberation, and the key factors are price per square meter and the largest loan one can get. This seems to be a far cry from the Schelling model. This point is considered in great detail in <span class="citation" data-cites="Hatna2012Schelling">(Hatna and Benenson 2012)</span>, which looks at segregation in two mixed cities in Israel.</p>

</div></div><p><strong>Peer effects</strong> can have a <strong>contagious mechanism</strong> a kin to the spread of diseases. Another aspect of peer effects is called “the tail is wagging the dog,” where a small minority sets the tone for the whole group. Situations where behavior in which the most extremist people at the tail end of the political distribution determine what will happen will always be challenging to predict, for instance, political uprisings like the fall of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a> and more recently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> in Ukraine. In such cases, it is difficult to predict what will happen, and the Granovetter Model explains that it is a microcosm in which we can study why it is so challenging to predict such events.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="granovetter1983threshold granovetter1986threshold granovetter1988threshold">(Granovetter and Soong 1983, 1986, 1988)</span> the authors discusses <strong>Granovettor’s Threshold Model</strong> which can be described by:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> population size.</li>
<li>Agent <em>j</em> has a participation threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_j"> and will only participate if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_j"> others individuals participate.</li>
<li>An Agent with a threshold of 0 will always participate.</li>
<li>An Agent with a threshold of 10 will wait till it sees 10 other agents participating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the outcome varies depending on the distribution of thresholds.</p>
<p>Assume that there are five individuals and that the behavior is participating in a riot.</p>

<p>Every agent will, in turn, join the protest even though the collective isn’t as polarized as the previous one. We can see this is a case where the extremists set the tone.</p>
<p>We can conclude that in this model of collective action, participation is more likely when :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The thresholds are lower</li>
<li>There is a greater variation of thresholds.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point is why it is so hard to predict if a riot or a run on a bank will take place. First, you need to estimate the level of discontentment and also the distribution of thresholds.</p>

<p>Granovettor’s Threshold model can explain participation in risky activities where risks and rewards are tied to the number of peers participating.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The basic SOP can be stated as follows: A brilliant economics lecture ends, and the audience begins to applaud. The applause builds, and tentatively, a few audience members may or may not decide to stand. Does a standing ovation ensue, or does the enthusiasm fizzle? — <span class="citation" data-cites="miller2004standing">(Miller and Page 2004)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Formal Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents are seated in a rectangular auditorium with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> rows and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> seats per row.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of a performance, each agent makes an evaluation of the performance’s quality.</li>
<li>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_%7Bij%7D%20%E2%88%88%20Q_%7Bij%7D%20=%20%5B0,%201%5D"> represent the quality signal received by the audience member seated in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">th row and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th seat.
<ul>
<li>Higher values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_%7Bij%7D"> represent greater perceived quality.</li>
<li>For the moment, values may be thought of as either private or common with idiosyncratic noise, or some convex combination of the two.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each audience member possesses an exogenous threshold level in addition to his or her quality evaluation.
<ul>
<li>The threshold level for the agent in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"><sup>th</sup> row and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"><sup>th</sup> seat, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bij%7D"> , equals the minimal quality required for that agent to stand immediately.</li>
<li>Thus, if an audience member’s private value weakly exceeds the threshold, that is if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cge%20T_%7Bij%7D"> , she stands immediately. If not, she remains seated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%5Et_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B0,%201%5C%7D"> denote whether or not the audience member is standing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(s%5Et_%7Bij%7D=1)"> or sitting <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(s%5Et_%7Bij%7D=0)"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> time periods after the completion of the performance, and let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%5Et"> be the total number of audience members standing at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Therefore,</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AS%5E0%20%20=%20%5Csum%20%5EC_%7Bj=1%7D%5Csum%20%5ER_%7Bi=1%7D%20s%5E0_%7Bij%7D%0A"></p>
<p>equals the number of agents standing immediately. In interesting cases, only a fraction <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0%20%3C%20S%200%20%3C%20R%20%5Ccdot%20C)"> of the audience stands immediately. With a portion of the audience standing, those who remain seated must decide whether to stand, and those audience members standing must decide whether to remain standing or to sit. Both decisions rely on local information—possibly the number of neighbors standing or the percentage of audience members within sight who are standing—as well as the initial quality appraisal of the individual.</p>
<p>For example, someone seated surrounded entirely by people who are standing most likely will stand, unless she abhorred the performance. Similarly, unless she felt that the performance was stupendous, an isolated standing person may decide to sit if her neighbors do not join the standing ovation quickly.</p>
<p>The behavior of an audience member at a particular point in time can be represented by a heuristic that maps her information and quality appraisal into an action, either sit or stand. Periods are considered as discrete units. The continuous time case shall be addressed later in the discussion of random asynchronous and endogenous asynchronous updating. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K_%7Bij%7D"> be the seat assignments visible to the audience member in the ith row and jth seat. Define a <em>behavioral rule</em> at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20%3E%200%20%5Ctext%7B%20by%20%7D%20F%5Et%20:%20K%5Et%20%C3%97%20Q_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cto%20%5C%7B0,%201%5C%7D%20%5Ctext%7B%20for%20%7D%20t%20%5Cge%201">. Recall that in period 0, the decision to stand depends only on the agent’s threshold and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_%7Bij%7D">.</p>
<hr>
<p>The authors discuss the math and internals of their models as form of noisy channel. Agents need to fuse a signal based on their private information with the information coming from their peers and arrive at a binary decision.</p>
<p>The standing ovation model by Scott and Miller is intentionally presented in the most vague form according to their later publication. This is rather annoying as without a more formal spec it isn’t possible to reproduce any results. Also most people don’t actually seem to implement it as explained in the lesson or the paper.</p>
<p>I found the paper <span class="citation" data-cites="miller2004standing">(Miller and Page 2004)</span> rather tiresome and had to have a few goes at it. The authors’ exhortation exaltation on the grandeur of their model is matched by the vagueness of its definitions — basically there are any number of variants and extensions of the standing ovation models. Criticism aside I noticed some point of interest in the paper:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>cascades</strong> I was a momentarily shocked to see many references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade">information cascades</a> in the paper, which I mentioned above. It is evident the authors are well versed on this subject well begging the question, why it this not covered in the course but rather named tips etc.</li>
<li><strong>ANTs</strong> (Active Nonlinear Tests) are another interesting idea - i.e.&nbsp;using them to break the model. This seems to be a from of fuzz testing. At this point though I was still more interested in demonstrating that the model actually works.</li>
<li>Eventually, I noticed there was a section called the formal model which defined the model more precisely.</li>
<li>There is also a section on implementing an ABM version with a number of variations they had considered which I summarized below, indicating if I have implemented them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than go into great detail about the model, I coded it using Mesa. Coding this model required some customization of the framework and that makes more advanced but also more educational. Also I can say that the lesson explained the model rather poor and that only by implementing the model did I get to understand this model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents are initialized as either standing or not, as with no one is standing at the start the will be no standing ovation.</li>
<li>At each time step, agents decide to stand based on a Signal &gt; Threshold where the signal is based on the Quality and an error. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S=Q+%5Cepsilon%20%3E%20T"></li>
</ul>
<p>Some variations they discuss are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>updating: <sup>5</sup></p>
<ul>

<li>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is small, people will jump on any bandwagon.</li>
<li>For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q%20%3C%20T">, greater variation in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> will help the standing ovation spread by increasing a contagion-like effect - as we saw in the previous model.</li>

<figcaption>Standing ovation - Celebrity view</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div><p>Standing ovation is more likely to emerge when:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If Quality is higher.</li>
<li>Thresholds are lower,</li>
<li>There is a more substantial peer effect</li>
<li>There is a greater variation in thresholds or errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three are obvious. Scott suggested that the last one was discovered by implementing his standing ovation model. Once we know about the Granovettor model’s requirement for agents to have different thresholds to enable participation to spread, it is obvious.</p>
<p>The model simplifies reality by excluding factors like the shape of the theater and the locations where people are situated or by assuming people act independently when most people come in pairs or larger groups.</p>
<p>Scott later discusses <strong>social roles</strong>, which he calls celebrities and academics, that would emerge in a more sophisticated model with a spatial layout with a front and a back. In the first chapter of Micro Motives and Macro Behavior, I later noticed that Schelling analyzed a surprising sitting arrangement that emerged in one of his talks, eliminating many hypotheses.</p>

</figure>
</div></div><p>Agents in the front may be assigned a “celebrity” role; they can influence everybody behind them but are not influenced by others. Agents in the back may be assigned an “academic” role. They can see their immediate neighborhood but are unseen by many others.</p>
<p>Scott claims that the standing ovation model is helpful in other scenarios, which is termed fertility for models. The standing ovation model may be useful in modeling collective action problems. However, he doesn’t make a very strong case.</p>

<p>The challenge of distinguishing whether individuals associate with one another due to sorting (as discussed by Schelling) or peer influence (illustrated by the standing ovation example) varies in complexity. In specific scenarios, like Racial segregation, the distinction is straightforward.</p>
<p>However, the situation becomes murkier in other instances. Consider the phenomenon of happy people gravitating towards other happy individuals and the same pattern is observed among those who are unhappy. In these cases, both sorting and peer effects could be at play, and often, it’s challenging to pinpoint which is the driving force since the end result appears the same for both mechanisms. Therefore, simply observing the outcome won’t provide clarity. Sorting, characterized by the physical movement of individuals, necessitates dynamic data for accurate identification.</p>
<p>Author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bishop_(author)">Bill Bishop</a>, discusses sorting in <span class="citation" data-cites="bishop2009big">(Bishop 2009)</span> the. For example, in recent years, many counties in the USA have become more polarized. Bishop argues that this occurs due to sorting. However, gerrymandering is a more likely root cause.</p>

<p>With migration data, it’s simpler to establish whether like-mindedness is caused by sorting or peer effects.</p>

<p>Models work because they are <em>abstractions</em> that simplify.</p>
<p>Models have become essential to the <em>lingua franca</em> <sup>7</sup> of academia, business, and even politics. Companies regularly place models in their production systems, automating decisions and improving internal processes.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;new language</p></div></div><p>Dr Page alludes to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World">Great Books Movement</a>, which by all accounts was a failure not only tried to sell out copyright books to its clients but also claimed to inform the intelligentsia with a collection of ideas they should be familiar with. One such idea is <strong>“tie yourself to the mast”</strong>, alluding to Odysseus’ request from the Odyssey where he wished to the siren’s song. This idea recurs with the British painter Turner, who wanted to observe a storm.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Page points out that proverbs that encode these ideas sometimes come in contradictory pairs, e.g.:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Two heads are better than one”</p>
</blockquote>
</div><div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“he who hesitates is lost.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div><div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A stitch in time saves nine.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Page succinctly states, <mark>“Models tie us to a mast of logic.”</mark> When we run a model, we can avoid being swayed by our biases and usually also get an estimate of how well this outcome fits with observed reality.</p>
<p>Many sciences rely on models. Game theory models are foundational in understanding behavior in economics, political science, and even linguistics. Networks are used in sociology, ecology, and biology.</p>
<p>Another reason to use models is that they are better at predicting than making a decision or an estimate without one. The following section makes the point that using multiple models is even better.</p>

<p>Let us review the groups we can see in the graph:</p>

This is the type of analyst <span class="emoji" data-emoji="tv">📺</span> TV panels tend to feature — wrong but consistently wrong <span class="emoji" data-emoji="x">❌</span> for decades.</p></li>

<p>Modeling following the reductionist approach in science. The let us think <span class="emoji" data-emoji="thinking">🤔</span> more precisely about how things work and in the process we get to throw out any parts that are less important.</p>
<p>Using models consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Name the parts</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If we build a real estate regression model for pricing, you need to collect data on apartments, such as location, historical prices, size, rooms, floor, view, directions, and neighborhood.</li>
<li>If we build a movie recommendation system, we need to identify the movies, their rating, and the people who watched and ranked them.</li>
<li>If we need to model a marketing website, we need to know the customers, their customer journey, their interaction with ads, landing pages, product and information pages, shopping carts, checkout forms, inventories, and social media, as well as minor events and particularly <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/micro-moments/zero-moment-truth/">ZMOT</a>. All these and more are available from web/app analytics products and from advertising platforms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Identify the relationships between the parts</strong>. In a regression, you get the coefficients that set the size of the effect that changing the explanatory variables has on the response variable.
<ul>
<li>in game theory model we consider the relationships between action by player 1, subsequent actions by player 2 and thier ultimate payoffs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Work through the logic</strong>. :::</li>
</ol>
<div id="exa-around-the-world">

<p><strong>Inductively</strong> explore adding one case at a time until you arrive at a general rule</p>
<p>Models of <span class="emoji" data-emoji="butterfly">🦋</span> dynamical systems <span class="emoji" data-emoji="cloud_with_lightning_and_rain">⛈️</span> have different classes <sup>11</sup> of outcomes, these are:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn11"><p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;each may take different forms</p></div></div><ol type="1">

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn12"><p><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Chaotic</p></div></div><p>Models can help us to predict which of these outcomes will materialize.</p>
<p>For instance, the supply and demand for oil might increase in a relatively consistent pattern. The cost of oil is influenced by various factors, including reserves, market participants, political dynamics, etc., making its price complex and difficult to forecast, yet not entirely unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>Identify logical boundaries</strong>. Models help us determine what context is relevant and at what point it is no longer applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate communication</strong>. Taking politics as an example: by evaluating how liberal or conservative both a candidate and a voter are, we can place them in a model to see which candidate aligns more closely with the voter’s preferences. This can be used to choose the best talking point for a call to that voter soliciting a campgn contribution.</p>

<p>Another model type is the explicative model, which can be used to understand and understand data.</p>
<p><strong>Understand patterns</strong>. e.g., fluctuations in GDP growth can be explained by a business cycle model.</p>
<p><strong>Extrapolate</strong>. e.g., if the price of a house in a neighborhood is a linear function of the number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%5E2">, and you know the number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%5E2">, then you could use the function to predict the price of the house via the point value on the function graph;</p>
<p><strong>Produce bounds</strong> models that capture uncertainty like an estimate of inflation ten years hence should produce a range rather than one specific number; this range can be used as a lower and upper bound in any downstream tasks</p>
<p><strong>Retrodict</strong> <sup>13</sup>. We can use models with the data to predict the past. If we have missing data in our historical records, we can put our model to work to interpolate the missing past. This is also called retrodiction or imputation. Another way we use past data is for model cross-validation, where we omit part of the data from model training and then evaluate the model on the held-out data.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn13"><p><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;predict the past</p></div></div><p><strong>Predict other things</strong>. If you build a model that is good at predicting the unemployment rate, you are well on the way to predicting the inflation rate, which we call a downstream task. In astronomy, early models of the solar system predicted an unknown planet; guided by this, astronomers pointed the telescopes into the night sky and soon discovered Neptune.</p>
<p><strong>Informed data collection</strong>. When we build a a model to predict school performance to help improve education policy, we begin by naming the parts, in these case, we might choose the following explanatory variables: teacher quality, the parents’ highest level of education, absences, the school’s budget, size of the classroom, etc. We fit the model and we can quickly see if we need more data. Thus the model informs us determine which and how much data we need to collect.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate hidden parameters</strong><sup>14</sup>. We can use data to tell us more about the model and then use the model to tell us more about the world.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn14"><p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;latent variables</p></div></div><p>the SIR model is an established contagion model describing the spread of diseases. SIR is an acronym for the compartments of <em>Susceptible</em>, <em>Infected</em>, and <em>Recovered</em> individuals. Once we observe the data on how many people are in each compartment, we can predict how an epidemic will progress over time.</p>
<p><strong>Calibrate</strong>. After constructing a model, one should calibrate it to the data so that its predictions are as close as possible to our view of the real world.</p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 2 (Company bailout)</strong></span> We can use the <a href="@fig-co-risks">co-risk graph</a> to understand the network of relationships between financial institutions like Morgan Stanley, Bear Sterns, AIG, etc. in, in terms of how their economic success or failure are correlated to one another. Notice the hubs in red, Bear Sterns, and AIG. The layman’s term for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">Too big to Fail</a>.</p>
<p>The US government, facing the prospect of cascading failure of it largest financial institutions, has to decide which banks to bail out and which ones to allow to fail. The graph which shows the dependence between the top financial institutions indicating how likely one would fail would cascade to the other.</p>
<p>If AIG were to fail, this would be the worst-case scenario. If we sum up its incoming arrows, we get about 3000 units of systemic risk influence. Now, if we consider Lehman Brothers, it has about 190 units of systemic risk. This type of chart makes it clear that failing to bail out AIG would risk all the big banks going bankrupt, while letting Lehman Brothers fail would impact only a small part of the market</p>

<p>Auction theory is perhaps the most prominent application of mechanism design, where the goal is to allocate items or rights (like public good like bandwidth, a license or a patent) to those who value them the most.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-components-of-the-stanley-reiter-diagram">Components of the Stanley Reiter Diagram</h4>
<p>The diagram typically consists of the following main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agents</strong>: These are the participants in the mechanism. Each agent has private information, such as preferences, valuations, or types, that is relevant to the decision-making process.</li>
<li><strong>Message Space</strong>: For each agent, there is a message space that represents all possible messages or reports that the agent can send within the mechanism. These messages are how agents communicate their private information.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome Space</strong>: This is the set of all possible outcomes that can result from the mechanism. Outcomes could be allocations of goods, pricing decisions, policy choices, etc., depending on the context of the mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Social Choice Function</strong> (SCF): The SCF is a theoretical concept representing the ideal decision rule that maps the true state of the world (the agents’ private information) directly to outcomes. However, because the mechanism designer does not have direct access to the agents’ private information, the SCF cannot be implemented directly.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">: The mechanism itself is represented in the diagram by two main components: the message profile (a combination of messages sent by all agents) and the outcome function. The outcome function takes the message profile as input and determines an outcome based on the rules of the mechanism.</li>

<li>Visualizing Mechanism Design: It provides a visual framework to understand how mechanisms can be designed to achieve specific objectives, such as truthfulness, efficiency, or fairness, by processing private information.</li>
<li>Illustrating the Role of Incentives: The diagram helps in analyzing how different mechanisms can create incentives for agents to report their private information truthfully or behave in a manner that leads to desirable outcomes.</li>
<li>Designing and Comparing Mechanisms: Laying out the components of different mechanisms allows for a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in achieving various economic and social goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite its abstract nature, the Stanley Reiter diagram is a powerful tool for understanding the process of mechanism design, highlighting the interaction between private information, strategic behavior, and collective decision-making in economic systems.</p>

<p>This is the domain of decision models. These can be simple like a classification model or complex like a recommendation system.</p>

<p>Say we need to choose a market for pollution permits or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading">carbon emission trading</a> system. However, if you review the Wikipedia article, you will see many different options. What we can do is build a (simple) model and use it to tell which one is going to work better. This might be more objective since there are lobbying and external interests at play in such a decision.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reducing-green-house-emissions-1">Reducing Green House emissions</h2>
<p>We need to decide about measures to reduce temperature and mitigate pollution. Green spaces is generaly an improvement. But after adding such an area people could move next to that and build houses all around it, which just leads to even greater sprawl. Perhaps planting trees along the streets is a better alternative?</p>

<p>So what may seem like a good idea the first time you think <span class="emoji" data-emoji="thinking">🤔</span> about it may not look so hot once you look at it through the lens of a model?</p>
